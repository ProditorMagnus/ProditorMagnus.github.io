<pre>Cho Chang spent two nights in the Ministry Holding Cells. But she wasn't alone. Her father, Lord Xi Chang had tried to argue with Amelia about his daughter's arrest, and how she should be placed on house arrest so he could watch her. He got part of his wish to watch her – he spent two nights in the same cell as his daughter.</pre>

<pre>After being taught by a werewolf and a Longbottom, Professor Malfoy was a bitter disappointment. All she did was regurgitate the Ministry-approved curriculum from their textbooks. Only one fact kept the students from falling asleep during the History of Magic. Every one-hundredth second Narcissa's robes briefly became transparent. The effect was so quick that the witch didn't even notice it, but every wizard in the class sure did. The Weasley twins had provide them all with wanking material for the next few months. But it wasn't enough.

"Did you see Professor Lockhart and Professor Malfoy during dinner tonight?" Susan asked. "She was actually feeding him food with her hands. I thought that Draco was going to challenge him to a Duel right in middle of the Great Hall."

"I think they are doing it," Harry said as they made their way down to Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party.

"Please watch your language," Hermione snapped.

"Yes, Harry Potter. What you should have said is: I think they are having sexual intercourse with each other," Luna told him.

According to both Lily's Map and the Marauder's Map, Harry was right. Narcissa and Gilderoy were going at it like rabbits at all hours of the day. It seems as if Lucius wasn't performing too well in the bedroom, because Voldemort only dosed Lockhart with Amortentia. Narcissa was acting of her own free will.

Voldemort was gambling that Dumbledore would head to the dungeons first before checking on Ginny's medical condition. At this very moment Snape would be filling the Headmaster's ears with well-constructed lies like a good Slytherin. But that didn't matter, because Voldemort was a Slytherin too.

"Well Poppy, what is Miss Weasley's diagnosis?" Dumbledore asked an hour later. For reasons that defied logic, the Headmaster had brought Snape along with him to the Infirmary.

"Individually none of the curses were life-threatening, but the cumulative effect almost killed the child. Albus, this is one of the most barbaric things I have ever seen during my career as a Healer."

"Yes, the poor Ginny was having a difficult time adjusting to life here at Hogwarts, and I am afraid she hurt herself," Dumbledore intoned. "Accidentally, of course."

Pomfrey stared at the Headmaster for a good minute before speaking. "None of her wounds were self-inflicted. Not a single one. And all of my medical records will reflect that fact."

"Records are easily altered," Snape remarked.

"But my official medical testimony to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is not," Pomfrey shot back.

Dumbledore quickly stepped in between the two. "Poppy, given the current political climate, Hogwarts simply can't afford a scandal of this nature. You will list this case as an attempted suicide, and I will personally deal with the Weasley family."

"And if I refuse?" the Healer asked.

"Then I will deal with you," Snape sneered. "It's past time you were taught your place."

"Avada Kedavra."

Arthur Weasley was still partially hidden under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, but his Killing Curse still struck Severus Snape right in the chest. The Potion Master dropped to the floor, dead.

"I'm curious Albus. Just how were you going to explain Ginny's condition to Molly and me? After all our years of loyal service, this is how you repay my family."

"Arthur, what have you done!" a weeping Albus demanded as he knelt down next to the corpse.

"I did what should have been years ago. Severus Snape was a rabid dog, and you allowed him to run free for too long," Arthur replied as he turned to leave. "Poppy please take care of my daughter. I want Ginny moved to St Mungo's as soon as it is safe for her to travel."

"Where are you going?" Pomfrey asked.

"I have to turn myself in to the Aurors. Please take care of her."

From the corner of the room Voldemort had watched the whole scene play out from under a Disillusionment Charm. If things kept going this well a full-blown civil war would break-out by the end of the year.

Lucius Malfoy desperately wanted the Dementor's Kiss for his old enemy Arthur Weasley, but Voldemort knew he would never pass-up a chance to attack Dumbledore directly. Lucius also needed to protect Draco and any other Slytherins who might have been involved in the attack on Ginny. To this end he feed the Daily Prophet several anonymous (and false) stories about Severus Snape, and the depravities he practiced on his students. Rita Skeeter ate it up with a spoon, and her articles over the next week crucified Dumbledore for allowing such a monster to teach at Hogwarts.

Calls for a new Headmaster grew louder each day. Dumbledore knew he had to throw a bone to the angry mob, so Professor McGonagall was forced to resign as the Deputy Headmistress. The Board of Governors demanded a strong replacement, and only one wizard had the necessary stature. In addition to serving as the new Deputy Headmaster, Horace Slughorn would also teach Potions and act as the Head of House for Slytherin. Voldemort was thrill that his favorite Professor would be returning to the castle.

The wheels of justice can move very quickly in the magical world—when it suits the Wizengamot's interests. As with most things that corrupt institution dealt with, the trial was decided on the basis of lineage. The Weasley family had been purebloods for over ten generations, and it didn't hurt that Arthur was one of the few popular figures working at the Ministry of Magic. On the other hand Snape was a half-blood misanthrope whose father had been a filthy muggle. It was also known that he was Dumbledore's personal spy, and that name was political poison at the moment.

The outcome of the trial was never in doubt. If Arthur Weasley hadn't used an Unforgivable Curse he probably would have gotten off with a minor fine for murdering Severus Snape. Instead he was sentenced to six months in a Ministry holding cell. Azkaban was no place for a wizard who had only been defending the honor of his pureblood daughter.

+

"So Percy, what do you think?" Voldemort asked as he gestured towards the hideous half-human and half-Acromantula monster they had magically manufactured.

True to his promise, Voldemort had captured Rita Skeeter while she was in her Animagus form. He brought her here to the Chamber of Secrets, and then fed her a Polyjuice Potion containing a hair from an Acromantula. The transformation had been excruciating, but Skeeter deserved this and far worse for calling his wife a gold-digger.

"My Lord, I don't think she will survive. The changes to her gross anatomy are just too traumatizing," Percy theorized. Since Vito Potter had saved Ginny's life in the Slytherin common room, the boy had become even more devoted to his new master. As a reward Voldemort allowed Percy to use his wand from time to time.

"I was hoping that her experience as an Animagus would allow her magic to cope with the transformation, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Give her a dose of the Elixir of Life. We can't have her dying on us just yet. I will work on further modifications to the Polyjuice Potion, and then we can try again in a few weeks."

"What should I do with her in the interim?" Percy asked.

"My first instinct would be to give her a Draught of Living Death, but I don't want any other potions to interfere with our future experiments. That means she will have to be kept fully conscious," Voldemort replied. "She will make every attempt to escape the Chamber of Secrets. That will include trying to seduce you."

"My Lord, I would never betray you," Percy said quickly.

"I know that, and I value your loyalty. But if you want to let Skeeter believe that you are plotting to escape... well, that is perfectly acceptable to me."

+

Voldemort found it amusing that after all this time people still believed he had cursed the DADA position. All he really did was write a letter to each of the new professors, asking them over for a spot of tea at the end of the school year. A few words from the Dark Lord was more than enough to send them all running, and he never once used his wand.

+

"I am a pureblood witch and a duelist. I have no desire to become a common actress."

"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."

"Quoting the muggles, my husband?" Bellatrix asked as they entered Gringotts and joined one of the queues. "I never thought I would live long enough to see that happened."

"You have never complained about my fondness for the Bard before," Voldemort pointed out. "In fact you seemed to enjoy the St Crispin's Day speech when I recited it this morning."

"I always wondered what you were saying in Parseltongue down there."

"Now you know."

"Next," the goblin teller bellowed. "What do you what?"

"I want access to this Vault," Bellatrix said as she handed the beast a key that she had wisely hidden before being sent to Azkaban. "This specific Vault, and I will need five minutes."

The words five minutes were a code which meant the customer was offering a five thousand galleon bribe in return for coöperation and secrecy. This amount was high, but not unheard of—especially considering the result Death Eater activity. The beast gave them a hard look, and its beady eyes suddenly opened wide. Goblins might have a had time telling one human from another, but his wife's pink hair was memorable. Voldemort's gamble had paid off.

"Follow me Mrs and Mr Potter, I will take you down to the Lestrange Vault myself."

The teller assumed that since Dora and Bellatrix were related by blood she had stolen her Aunt's key, and was planning to rob her Vault. Inter-family theft was common (and quasi-legal) in the magical world, and Gringotts was happy to look the other way in return for a healthy bribe.

As the cart passed through the Thief's Downfall Voldemort felt a chill run through his body. The foul Goblin magic removed any Concealment Spells from a wizard or witch, but it had no effect on Bellatrix. After passing by a blind guardian dragon they finally reached the Lestrange Vault.

"Do not disturb us," Bellatrix hissed as she closed the Vault door behind them.

"Now you said that everything was protected by Geminio and Flagrante?" Voldemort asked as he used his magic to search the through the contents of the Vault. When he was sure he had located all the traps a flick of his wand disabled them. Then he reached down and grasped the Hufflepuff Cup. After all these years his soul and his magic would once again be complete.

"My Lord, you said that this ritual was very painful. Are you sure you wish to undergo it here at Gringotts? Perhaps we should return to the Chamber of Secrets," Bellatrix suggested.

"No, I have waited too long for this moment. I will not wait any longer." Voldemort spoke the ancient incantation and fell to the floor of the Vault in agony.



"That looked enjoyable, my Lord. Would it be possible for me to experience it myself?" Bellatrix asked.

"I would have to kill you first," a groggy Voldemort replied, a prospect the witch didn't seem to mind. "How long was I unconscious?"

"Nearly three hours. The Goblins must think that we are trying to conceive a child on the piles of gold galleons. I once heard a rumor that all their children are spawned in such a fashion."

Voldemort laughed as he hadn't laughed in years. "Oh Bella, how I have missed you. You are such a rare combination of power, beauty, and wit."

That compliment earned him one of her rare blushes. Voldemort seized his wand, and felt his magic surged through him. All of his magic. He was once again the most powerful wizard in the world. A true Dark Lord.

"Come along, we wasted too much time already."

When they made it back up to the crowded lobby of the Gringotts, Voldemort reached into his pocket and pulled out a Sugar Quill. He then transfigured it into a short sword and stabbed Bellatrix in the back. The sword cut her heart clean in half before exiting the front of her chest in a geyser of hot blood.

"I truly am sorry," Voldemort whispered in Bellatrix's ear as she dropped to her knees. "But I have Dora now. You are just an older and inferior model whose services I no longer require."

+

The party was in full swing in the Hufflepuff common room that night, and for the badgers all was right with the world. After his exhausting duel Vito quickly made his way back to the Chamber of Secrets, and retrieved one of the Time-Turners he had hidden there. At the very moment the Portkey trophy caused one Vito Potter to disappear from Hogwarts, another Vito Potter appeared from under Harry's Invisibility Cloak covered with green slime. The switch was perfectly timed, and of course Fred and George were blamed for pranking the trophy. A furious Headmaster Slughorn gave the twins detention for the rest of the school year.</pre>

<pre>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."

What?

"I'm allergic to your hair shampoo -"

And then the Sorting Hat sneezed, with a mighty "A-CHOO!" that echoed around the Great Hall.

"Well!" Dumbledore cried jovially. "It seems Harry Potter has been sorted into the new House of Achoo! McGonagall, you can serve as the Head of House Achoo. You'd better hurry up on making arrangements for Achoo's curriculum and classes, tomorrow is the first day!"

"But, but, but," stammered McGonagall, her mind in nearly complete disarray, "who will be Head of House Gryffindor?" It was all she could think of, she had to stop this somehow...

Dumbledore put a finger to his cheek, looking thoughtful. "Snape."

Snape's screech of protest nearly drowned out McGonagall's, "Then who will be Head of Slytherin?"

"Hagrid."

+

"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."

What?

"Ordinarily I would refer such questions to the Headmaster, who could ask me in turn, if he wished. But some of the information you've asked for is not only beyond your own user level, but beyond the Headmaster's."

How can I raise my user level?

"I'm afraid I am not allowed to answer that question at your current user level."

What options are available at my user level?

After that it didn't take long -

"ROOT!"

+

The frightened silence was broken by a single word.

"Headmaster!" called the Sorting Hat.

At the Head Table, Dumbledore rose, his face puzzled. "Yes?" he addressed the Hat. "What is it?"

"I wasn't talking to you," said the Hat. "I was Sorting Harry Potter into the place in Hogwarts where he most belongs, namely the Headmaster's office -"

+ // chapter 11

"Hey!" Hermione said in tones of indignation from her place on the other side of the breakfast table. "That's everyone's dessert! You can't just take one whole pie and put it in your pouch!"

"I'm not taking one pie, I'm taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta run now!" Harry ignored the cries of outrage and left the Great Hall. He needed to arrive at Herbology class a little early.

+

Professor McGonagall walked over to the gargoyle, inaudibly spoke the password, and stepped through into the revolving spiral stairs. She began to rise out of sight, and the gargoyle started back -

"Professor McGonagall the Headmaster set fire to a chicken!"

+

Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster's office.

Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in four layers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before him, opposite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them was an empty wooden stool.

They were waiting for Harry Potter.

Harry, Minerva thought despairingly, you promised you wouldn't bite any teachers!

And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry's angry face and his outraged response: I said I wouldn't bite anyone who didn't bite me first!

There was a knock at the door.

"Come in!" Dumbledore called.

The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost gasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in control of himself.

"Good mor-" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.

Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring at Fawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes fluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a flame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy.

Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.

Dumbledore winked at him.

Minerva felt she was missing something.

Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry's face. His coolness wavered. Fear showed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm again.

A chill went down Minerva's spine. Something was not right here.

"Please sit down," said Dumbledore. His face was now serious once more.

Harry sat.

"So, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I've heard one report of this day from Professor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in your own words?"

Harry's gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. "It's not complicated," said the boy, smiling thinly. "He tried bullying me the way he's been bullying every non-Slytherin in the school since the day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for the other details, I request a private conversation with you concerning them. A student who is reporting abusive behavior from a professor can hardly be expected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after all."

This time Minerva couldn't stop herself from gasping out loud.

Severus simply laughed.

And the Headmaster's face grew grave. "Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said, "one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in such terms. I fear that you labor under a terrible misapprehension. Professor Severus Snape has my fullest confidence, and serves Hogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy's."

There was silence for a few moments.

When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. "Am I missing something here?"

"Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster. "You should understand, to start with, that the purpose of this meeting is to discuss how to discipline you for the events of this morning."

"This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to students and collected stories to make sure there would be enough for a newspaper campaign to rally the parents against him. Some of the younger students cried while they told me. I almost cried when I heard them! You allowed this abuser to run free? You did this to your students? Why?"

Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She'd - thought that, sometimes, but somehow she'd never quite -

"Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, "this meeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your disregard for school discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and I have agreed, that three full months of detention will be appropriate -"

"Declined," Harry said icily.

Minerva was speechless.

"This is not a request, Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said. The full, entire force of the wizard's gaze was turned on the boy. "This is your punishme-"

"You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the children placed in your care, and if your explanation is not sufficient then I will begin my newspaper campaign with you as the target."

Minerva's body swayed with the force of that blow, with the sheer raw lese majeste.

Even Severus looked shocked.

"That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise," Dumbledore said slowly. "I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard. For you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did not think that was your chosen side."

The boy was still for a long moment.

"This conversation grows private," Harry said. His hand flicked in Severus's direction. "Send him away."

Dumbledore shook his head. "Harry, did I not tell you that Severus Snape has my fullest confidence?"

The boy's face showed the shock of it. "This man's bullying makes you vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a newspaper campaign against you! This is insane! Why are you doing this?"

Dumbledore sighed. "I'm sorry, Harry. It has to do with things that you are not, at this time, ready to hear."

The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus. Then back to Dumbledore again.

"It is insanity," the boy said slowly. "You haven't reined him in because you think he's part of the pattern. That Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Master to be a proper magical school, just as it needs a ghost to teach History."

"That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't it?" said Dumbledore, smiling.

"Unacceptable," Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and dark. "I will not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many possible ways of dealing with this problem, but I will make it simple. Either this man goes, or I do."

Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus's eyes.

Now Dumbledore's gaze was also growing cold. "Expulsion, Mr. Potter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It is not customarily used as a threat by students against the Headmaster. This is the best magical school in the entire world, and an education here is not an opportunity given to everyone. Are you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without you?"

And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.

Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn't -

"You forget," Harry said, "that you're not the only one who can see patterns. This grows private. Now send him -" Harry flicked a hand at Severus again, and then stopped in mid-sentence and mid-gesture.

Minerva could see it on Harry's face, the moment when he remembered.

She'd told him, after all.

"Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, "once again, Severus Snape has my fullest confidence."

"You told him," whispered the boy. "You utter fool."

Dumbledore didn't react to the insult. "Told him what?"

"That the Dark Lord is alive."

"What in Merlin's name are you on about, Potter?" cried Severus in tones of sheer astonishment and outrage.

Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. "Oh, so we are a Slytherin, then," Harry said. "I was starting to wonder."

And then there was silence.

Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. "Harry, what are you talking about?"

"I'm sorry, Albus," Minerva whispered.

Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.

"Professor McGonagall didn't tell me," said Harry's voice, swiftly and less calm than it had been. "I guessed. I told you, I can see the patterns too. I guessed, and she controlled her reaction just as Severus did. But her control fell a shade short of perfection, and I could tell it was control, not genuine."

"And I told him," said Minerva, her voice trembling a little, "that you, and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew."

"Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going around asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn't talk," Harry said. The boy chuckled briefly. "I really should have gotten one of you alone and told you that she told me everything, to see if you let anything slip. Probably wouldn't have worked, but would have been worth a shot." The boy smiled again. "Threat's still on the table and I do expect to be briefed fully at some point."

Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised her chin and bore it. She knew it was deserved.

Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as cold as anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his brother died. "And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do not comply with your wishes."

Harry's voice was razor-sharp. "I regret to inform you that you are not the center of the universe. I'm not threatening to walk out on magical Britain. I'm threatening to walk out on you. I am not a meek little Frodo. This is my quest and if you want in you will play by my rules."

Dumbledore's face was still cold. "I am beginning to doubt your suitability as the hero, Mr. Potter."

Harry's return gaze was equally icy. "I am beginning to doubt your suitability as my Gandalf, Mr. Dumbledore. Boromir was at least a plausible mistake. What is this Nazgul doing in my Fellowship?"

Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he was following this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face away from Harry's field of vision and was smiling.

"I suppose," Dumbledore said slowly, "that from your perspective it is a reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is to leave you alone henceforth, will that be the last time this issue arises, or will I find you here every week with a new demand?"

"Leave me alone?" Harry's voice was outraged. "I am not his only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! Have you forgotten how defenseless children are? How much they hurt? Henceforth Severus will treat every student of Hogwarts with appropriate and professional courtesy, or you will find another Potions Master, or you will find another hero!"

Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous laughter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of him.

Minerva didn't dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that Severus was equally motionless.

Harry's visage grew even colder. "You mistake me, Headmaster, if you think that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your punishment."

"Mr. Potter -" Minerva said. She didn't even know what she was going to say. She simply couldn't let that go by.

Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to Dumbledore. "And if that seems impolite to you," Harry said, his voice now a little less hard, "it seemed no less impolite when you said it to me. You would not say such a thing to anyone who you considered a real human being instead of a subordinate child, and I will treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me -"

"Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there was one! Of course you're in here blackmailing me to save your fellow students, not to save yourself! I can't imagine why I would have thought otherwise!" Dumbledore was now laughing even harder. He pounded his fist on the desk three times.

Harry's gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her, addressing her for the first time. "Excuse me," Harry said. His voice seemed to be wavering. "Does he need to take his medication or something?"

"Ah..." Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.

"Well," said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in his eyes. "Pardon me. I'm sorry for the interruption. Please continue with the blackmail."

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a little unsteady. "Ah... he's also to stop reading students' minds."

"Minerva," Severus said, his voice deadly, "you -"

"Sorting Hat warned me," said Harry.

"What?"

"Can't say anything else. Anyway I think that's it. I'm done."

Silence.

"Now what?" Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one else was going to say anything.

"Now what?" Dumbledore echoed. "Why, now the hero wins, of course."

"What?" said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.

"Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner," Dumbledore said, smiling happily. "But Hogwarts does need an evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn't be a proper magical school, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful toward students in their fifth year and higher?"

"What?" said all three of them again.

"If it's the most vulnerable victims about whom you're concerned. Maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe I have forgotten over the decades what it's like to be a child. So let's compromise. Severus will continue to unfairly award points to Slytherin and impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be awful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To others he will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only read minds when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will have its evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as you put it, will be safe."

Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she'd ever been in her life. She glanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left completely neutral, as though he couldn't decide what sort of expression he ought to be wearing.

"I suppose that is acceptable," Harry said. His voice sounded a bit odd.

"You can't be serious," Severus said, his voice as expressionless as his face.

"I am very much in favor of this," Minerva said slowly. She was so much in favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her robes. "But what could we possibly tell the students? They might not have questioned this while Severus was... being awful to everyone, but -"

"Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible secret of Severus's and did a bit of blackmail," said Dumbledore. "It's true, after all; he discovered that Severus was reading minds, and he certainly did blackmail us."

"This is insanity!" exploded Severus.

"Bwah ha ha!" said Dumbledore.

"Ah..." said Harry uncertainly. "And if anyone asks me why fifth years and above got shafted? I wouldn't blame them for being irate, and that part wasn't exactly my idea -"

"Tell them," said Dumbledore, "that it wasn't you who suggested the compromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to say anything more. That, too, is true. There's an art to it, you'll pick it up with practice."

+

Minerva shook her head. "Mr. Potter, you underestimate the importance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself -" She paused. That hadn't come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore, and even Harry were giving her strange looks. "To learn, I mean. Not every child can learn in the absence of authority. And it is the other children who will be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they see your example as one to be followed."</pre>

<pre>After a while their classes started to get boring again, so Voldemort began looking for a hobby while he waited for Dumbledore to make his next move. He found one thanks to Gamera. Harry's pet fire crab was a native of Fuji and he disliked his daily swims in the cold waters of the Black Lake. Voldemort also missed the swimming club he used to attend with Harry, so he asked Professor Sprout for permission to renovate the abandoned Roman-style baths located in a neglected section of the castle.

It had been over six-hundred years since the Baths of Hogwarts were in regular use. As far as anyone could determine they had been closed because of a spike in the number of pregnant school-age witches during the early fourteen century. Thankfully there had been a number of improvements in the Contraceptive Charm since then, so that wouldn't be a problem here in the late twentieth century.</pre>

<pre>"Harry, you just killed a wizard a week ago. Professor Quirrell wasn't strong, but he wasn't weak either. And there is also
the matter of your victory over the Dark Lord, who was a wizard of incredible strength. Draco can insist that you are a
squib until he is blue in the face, but a track record of two dead bodies is intimating to most wizards. Lucius would love to
see you dead, but not at the risk of his own neck."

"Alright, I have had enough of your crap," Harry snarled as he sent his own Charisma surging into them. "You may not
know it, but two can play at this game."
This turned out to be a bad idea on his part.
A very bad idea.
When his Charisma entered the Veela their Allure... changed? Transformed? Mutated? Even worse, it kept growing
stronger. It was like Harry was turning the Veela into magical transmitters, and they were broadcasting this strange new
Charisma/Allure hybrid in every direction. In less than a minute the entire tent was supersaturated with the stuff.
"Harry, what are you doing?" Su whispered as she looked around. Everyone present was either kissing or taking off their
clothes. Or doing both at the same time. Even the elderly wizards and witches were going at it like teenagers.
"I have absolutely no idea."
"Well, whatever it is, stop doing it."
"Don't you think I'm trying? I can't stop it. My magic and the magic of all these bloody Veela are now connected in some
way, and they are refusing to let go."
As things around them got progressively more pornographic, Harry and Su tried to figure out a way to severe the
connection, but nothing they tried worked. Hermione and Padma weren't any help, since they were now snogging each
other. All the adults were... busy, so they were useless too.</pre>

<pre>I ignored them, sauntering towards the door where the previous champions had exited. Suddenly, the Goblet flared
again, and Dumbledore cleared his throat. "It appears to be Harry Potter again…in different handwriting."

Back when I was a dark lord, I used to have a whole group of Death Eaters performing that task. I also had a group that
dealt with public relations. My decision to put Bellatrix in the latter group probably explains why I was considered a dark
lord and not a slightly over-zealous politician.

I turned around to find Hermione settling at the table with us, the Durmstrang champion standing awkwardly behind her
chair. She said, "Hi, Harry."
"Good to have you back with us," I said, glancing towards Luna, who had turned her attention to the dance floor.
Ginevra said, "I'm confused. Aren't you guys not speaking?"
Hermione primly set a napkin in her lap as Krum sat in the chair beside her. "Yes, well, I was going to wait until Harry
apologized, but then I realized that he would never actually do that. So I've just given up."
I patted her hand and graciously said, "Apology accepted Hermione."
She rolled her eyes. "Well, thank Merlin for that."
I turned to Ginevra. "It appears that we no longer need your help. You may go."
"But I'm your date!" she cried.
I paused for a moment. "Hm. You do have a point. I suppose you can stay for the evening, then. But no longer than that."
"How did you two end up going together, anyway?" Hermione asked. "You aren't exactly close."
"She was the only one who asked me, if you can believe that." I shook my head at my bad luck. Hermione just seemed
perplexed.
"Harry, you do realize that you were supposed to ask a girl out, right?"
"That makes absolutely no sense. I'm clearly the desirable one. Why should I have to demean myself?"

He dialed 62442. A woman's tinny voice said, "Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Who is this?"
Ron returned to his usual oafish demeanor. "Erm…"
"Percy Weasley," I shouted.
"What?" he squeaked.
"No one will notice the difference," I assured him.
Hermione said, "I hardly think –"
"What is your business here today, Mr. Weasley?" the voice asked.
Ron snorted. "Probably brownnosing."
"Thank you. Please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes."
He reached down, grabbed a chunky, silver badge from the chute, and burst into laughter.
"What is it?" Hermione asked.
Ron just shook his head, which had turned bright red. With trembling hands, he affixed the badge to his robes.
"Ron, I demand that you tell me what is so funny," I said.
The redhead, still grinning, turned so that the badge faced us, it blocky letters easily legible. It read:
Percival Weasley
Meeting the Minister

Hermione got a queer look on her face and asked, "Harry, just what do you think Dark Magic is?"
I snorted. "Secret magic retained within a family, obviously. That's why they call it Dark Magic. It's kept in the dark where
very few people get to see it."

"Hem, hem," Umbridge hem-hemed.
I turned Most Potente Potions to page four hundred and twelve.
"Hem, hem."
A flick of my wand sent three small fires dancing atop my desk. I glanced up disdainfully at her toad-like face. "What is it?"
"Can you tell me, Mr. Potter, why a cauldron is on top of your desk?"
I frowned, adjusting it slightly so that the fires evenly heated its pewter sides. "Felix Felicis is very sensitive to altitudes.
This isn't ideal, but it'll have to do."
She pursed her lips so that they looked a bit like a duck's bill. "And why aren't you reading your textbook?"
"I already did that," I said.
"In this class, we read the textbook," she said slowly, smiling as if I couldn't sense her evil intentions.
"Yes, which is why everyone hates your class" – I turned around to the seat behind me – "Right, Hermione?"
"Harry! You can't say things like that to professors."
I turned triumphantly back to Umbridge. "If she didn't hate your class, she would have said that. For instance, she'll never
accept that Potions might as well be self-study."

I said, "I've been living in a magically-expanded trunk."
Rita Skeeter gasped, and even her quill paused. "Oh, I wouldn't keep doing that. My coworker's father owned one of
those. The charms broke when he was inside, and they had to bury him in it. Two-hundred people attended the funeral,
social event of the season. I, of course, reported."
"I found another downside last June," I said.
Skeeter leaned forward eagerly, saying, "Really? Go on, don't keep us in suspense."
"Hermione mailed me to France. At least, I think it was France. Do they speak French anywhere else?"
Skeeter tapped her chin with a sharp, red-painted fingernail. "Well, there's Canada."
"No, that doesn't seem right," I muttered.
"Some parts of Africa, too," Ginevra said.
"That might have been it," I said. "Anyway, I tried to get back to Britain by crossing the nearest body of water, but that just
put me in Asia. So, now, I've been to all seven continents…At least, presuming that was Africa, and I've made a lot of
friends who I never intend to see again. But the weird part is that I don't feel like I've learned anything."
"Not every adventure has a moral lesson. Just the best ones," Ginevra said.
I shook my head. "No, I mean: I didn't learn anything. I didn't learn the Oriental mystic arts or any new languages. And I
still don't know what the Americans do. This trip was completely pointless."

Dumbledore looked around the ruined home. "I'm afraid I rarely have time for social visits lately. I'm here to offer you your
old position. There's no place safer than Hogwarts –"
"Tell that to the Perks girl," I muttered.
"–and you're clearly in hiding from Voldemort."
Slughorn chortled. "Yes, well, you see…I'm actually not. I was hiding from you. An old acquaintance of mine mentioned in
passing that you might be paying me this visit."
Dumbledore heaved a heavy sigh, as if he actually felt bad about manipulating everyone around him. "I am terribly sorry
to interrupt your retirement, but I'm afraid we're desperate. If you don't take the post, Harry Potter will. And he's not allowed
in the Potions room unsupervised."
"To be fair," I said, "no one died, and I was the one who reconstructed the floor."
Slughorn frowned, shifting his great weight from foot to foot. "Won't the Ministry give you someone, if no one else
applies?"
"I think I would prefer Harry," Dumbledore admitted. "Our last replacement was less than exemplary."
"Yes, I remember hearing about that. Umbridge was such a sweet, little Hufflepuff when I taught her. Never would have
imagined she'd attack the Boy-Who-Lived. Of course, the Boy-Who-Lived wasn't born then, so I suppose that's a
reasonable oversight."
Slughorn chuckled to himself, ending in a nervous cough upon realizing that no one had joined him. "Surely there's
someone else who can take the post…"
Dumbledore sighed. "I fear that young people nowadays just don't have the patience for potions. Hogwarts hasn't
graduated a Potions Master in over a decade."
I rolled my eyes. "Can't imagine why."
Dumbledore set a hand on Slughorn's shoulder. "Horace, do not force me to hire Harry Potter."
"I'm looking forward to being the Head of Slytherin," I said.
"That isn't a requirement," Dumbledore assured him. "Severus is still on staff."
Huh. I assumed it was position-based. Why else would the Potions classroom be in the dungeons, even though it lacks
a proper ventilation system and most of the fumes end up in the Slytherin common room?
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled with…Were those tears? "You are our last hope."
It seemed that I would not be on staff for the coming school year.

I settled back onto my seat. "After I defeated that dark lord in Albania, I might have been engaged to a nobleman's
daughter. Or he might have been yelling at me because that dark lord was one of the good ones. I'm not sure. I never
learned the language."
Ginevra walked in, flanked by Ron. "You probably shouldn't go to that country for a while, just to be on the safe side."
"I dunno about that. Is she a good-looking bird?" Ron asked. Hermione and Ginevra both leaned over to smack his arm,
although Ginevra then apologized to her for the presumption.

"Ginevra, did you put love potion in my eggs?"
"No," she said, shaking her head. "I haven't got all the ingredients yet."
"If I find out that you're lying…"
"Harry, if I had dosed you with Mum's potion, you would be kissing me right now. It's a really good potion."

Snape merely smirked at the wand jabbed into his neck. I said, "Alright, let's all calm down. We've already lost enough
people to Bellatrix's treachery."
In retrospect, her insistence on killing her fellow Death Eaters makes a lot more sense now. I continued, "So the
previous plan is ruined, then?"
"Yes, my lord," Lucius said, trying to hide within his hair.
I sighed. "I suppose we'll just have to floo in, then."
Sirius blinked. "Wait, we can do that?"
I shrugged, rising from my throne. "I don't see why not
+
"Good evening, my lord, my fellow Death Eaters, Mutt," Severus said, nodding to each of us in turn but reserving a sneer
for Sirius.
"What in Merlin's name happened?" I snapped.
"Apparently, an uninvited guest flooing into the Slytherin common room sends the entire castle into lockdown," Severus
said. "We were stuck there for hours."
I frowned. "Has Lucius been captured, then?"
"No, my lord. When Dumbledore arrived to interrogate him, Lucius claimed that he was doing a surprise inspection for
the Board of Governors. There was some suspicion when it turned out that the Board had not been aware of this, but he
reminded us all that he did say it was a surprise," Severus drawled.

"…fifty points to Luna Lovegood. For the most exquisite haircut I've seen since my childhood, fifty points to Ginevra
Weasley. For identifying Sirius Black and dueling him to a standstill, fifty points to Hermione Granger…"
Apparently, the latest battle had created quite a few heroes. Dumbledore had been going on for twenty minutes. His skin
was grey, his eyes dull, yet still he spoke. The students were whispering among themselves, and even the castle was
beginning to grow anxious, if the dancing silverware was any indication.
"…For Gryffindor bravery, quick feet, and sharp wit, fifty points to Neville Longbottom…"
The students laughed, clapping Neville on the back. I'm not sure why. Dumbledore was clearly insulting him.
"…For a stunning performance, fifty points to Ronald Weasley. Finally –"
A loud cheer greeted this statement, and Dumbledore paused until it quieted. "For demonstrating foreign language
proficiency in a poisonous situation, fifty points to Harry Potter. It appears that Gryffindor has won the Cup.
Congratulations to Gryffindor and to everyone who fought in this battle. Now, I can hear your stomachs rumbling from
here. So, without further ado –"
"May I speak, Headmaster?" I said, standing up to survey the disappointed crowd.
Dumbledore sighed. "Mr. Potter, you no longer have the authority to add or remove points."
"That's fine," I said with a negligent wave of my wand. I turned to the crowd. "Many of you fought bravely, yesterday. Many
more of you hid like firsties, most especially the firsties. Clearly, the Dark Lord is a dangerous foe, willing to hurt children
on a whim and ready to take Wizarding Britain under his reign. Keeping that in mind, I would like to announce that I am
no longer neutral on the Voldemort Issue."
I sat down, and the Leaving Feast appeared with a joyous pop.

"I wouldn't go in there if it was!" he cried. "My cousin had one of those. The thing broke and we had to bury him in it!"
The second snorted. "I know. I was at the funeral, too."
"Maybe this is a test," the taller said slowly, "from the Dark Lord. Maybe he's trying to trick us."
"Probly," the shorter said. "Bet we oughta take the trunk, though."
"I wouldn't be so sure. It could be booby-trapped."
"We can't just head back," he snapped. "I mean, someb ody around here said Voldemort!"
Pop! Pop!
The two earlier Death Eaters raised their hands while their compatriots scanned the clearing for enemies.
"Woah, woah, don't shoot. This moron here said Voldemort –"
They all groaned. Pop! Pop!
One of the men from the second group raised a hand for silence. "Okay. Clearly somebody said Vol…the word that
nobody's allowed to say."
They all breathed a sigh of relief. He continued, "Let's all agree to leave and not come back to this spot for a few minutes,
alright?"
The Death Eaters nodded, popping away.
I wandered back into the trunk, rousing Ron and Hermione. "Fair warning: We aren't allowed to say Voldemort, anymore.
So, if you really want to say Voldemort, I'd suggest you say Voldemort now because, in about five minutes, we have to
stop saying Voldemort."

Draco said, "You can't expect me to believe that the Weasleys managed to squeeze a Parselmouth from their impure
blood, no matter how many children they pop out."
Ron's face flushed bright red, but his angry exclamation was cut short by a calm voice below us. "I'm quite certain Ginny's
a Parselmouth. She taught me how to say my name in it and everything."
There is no word in that language which comes anywhere near Luna's name. I shudder to think what horribly
mispronounced nickname Ginevra had bestowed upon the poor girl.
The blonde was cheerfully waiting at the bottom of the steps with Hermione, who said, "Luna's guarding the door."
"You aren't Death Eaters polyjuiced to look like you four, are you?" the blonde politely inquired.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "If that were the case, why would I be here?"
"I'm not sure why you're here, anyway," Ron muttered.
I said, "To be fair, the Death Eaters might have run out of polyjuice."
"That would be pathetic," Draco said.
"It sounds fairly typical for them, really," I mused.
Ron chose to use his brain, and, as always, the result was a terrible disappointment. "Could you even beat that many
Death Eaters, Luna?"
Hermione pursed her lips. "It's more about sounding the alarm, Ronald."
"If she couldn't, why would they bother using polyjuice?" I added.
"I'll be fine. Neville even loaned me the Sword of Gryffindor." Luna hefted the sword and waved it at us.
Hermione's eye twitched. Violently. "You are a true Gryffindor."
"Not really," she said. "It's more about how you hold it."
"I –"
"Is that my House Elf?" Draco demanded, glaring into the Chamber where Dobby was scurrying about with a tray of
sandwiches.
"Oh, yes," Luna said. "Apparently, he's been stealing from you for several years. I think he's a true Slytherin."
Draco's agitated gaze swept over the room, eyes widening when he reached a small crowd towards the center.
"Snape?!"
"He's more of a Ravenclaw," Luna said.

The newly-crowned Aunt Hermione Granger-Weasley, Dark Lady and Minister of Magic for the British Isles, smiled at my
progeny. "She's adorable, Harry. What's her name?"
"Well, we decided that she needed a grand and terrifying title, much like Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. So I
named her after all of my greatest enemies."
Ron Weasley, conman and former werewolf, gaped at my brilliance. "You WHAT?"
Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose. "What did you end up with?"
"Her name is Severus Albus Lily Luna Lord Voldemort Potter."
Ginevra smiled. "We call her Sally for short."
"That's as many syllables as she can remember," I said fondly.</pre>

<pre>Harry was in a dark room, sat in a comfortable chair, drinking a red liquid from a glass cup. He was waiting in the waiting room of the ministry of magic. For some reason, the new wizengamot had requested his presence, intending to offer him an Order of Merlin for all his efforts, despite him being a Dark Lord. The only reason he showed up was because Astoria had forced him to, using the wife and daughter card.

"Your wife and daughter would be proud to see you receiving the reward for all your efforts." she had claimed and Harry had no reason to say no.</pre>

<pre>"And lastly I'd like to visit my vault, please," Sirius concluded the business he'd dealt with; the goblin teller widened his eyes in surprise.

"Mr Black, with the business you've done with us today you must know you don't have to visit your vault. For anything other than a major withdrawal you could easily have it done here and the appropriate monies will be transferred by us overnight."

"Much as I appreciate that, teller Bogrod, I do wish to visit the vault myself," he replied smoothly.

"Very well," Bogrod conceded with a sigh, "follow me please." The goblin led him to the mining carts that took customers deep into the bowels of the bank.

"Vault 711," he declared on arrival.

Sirius handed Bogrod his key and his guide opened the vault. Sirius stepped inside, pulling a distasteful face at some of the artefacts his family had deposited there over the centuries; he made a mental note to come along some day and dispose of any dark objects there. Bending down he picked up one gold galleon and one bronze knut. He pocketed the knut before exiting the vault and handing the galleon to a questioning Bogrod.

"For your trouble," he told him; the goblin looked astounded. "You see, I had dealings with Albus Dumbledore this morning and… well I rather suspected he might try some underhand way of following me to my new home in his attempts to kidnap my young godson," Bogrod's face morphed into a snarl at this disclosure. "So my real purpose for visiting was to go through the Thief's Downfall," he gestured to the waterfall, visible a few yards back up the track.

"A wise precaution given your suspicions," Bogrod agreed.

"Now, on our return, could I trouble you for use of a floo so that I need not return through the front of the bank?"

The goblin smiled and motioned to the cart.

Headmaster's Office,

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,

Alnwick

Dumbledore was bursting with impatient excitement as he sat behind his desk. The tracking charm he'd placed on Black back in the Ministry showed the man to be in Gringotts. From there he would surely be returning to France where he would meet up with Harry, leading Albus straight to the boy. And then, and then…

Nothing. The tracker died in his hands. Dumbledore shook it in frustration but it stubbornly refused to work; Sirius had vanished and he had no idea where he'd gone.

Albus wanted to weep. Instead he called for Fawkes and made his way quickly to the bank. After all, Harry Potter must be found, and soon.

Gringotts Bank,

Diagon Alley, London

Bogrod returned to his counter, opening it up again as the luridly-robed wizard pushed his way to the front, much to the annoyance of the bank's other clients. The goblin snarled at this show of rudeness and lack of basic etiquette; it was never going to endear Dumbledore to his hosts.

"Welcome to Gringotts," he began; Dumbledore attempted to interrupt, knowing that this formality was the prelude to a five minute introduction to the bank, something the goblins enjoyed rolling out for "difficult" customers. The wizard was unsuccessful in heading Bogrod off and had to stand there impotently as the interminable spiel continued.

"Thank you for that detailed overview," he forced himself to say once the goblin shut up, "I was hoping you can help me."

This proved a mistake as it allowed Bogrod to spend another five minutes listing the various accounts and services that Gringotts made available to its clientele, along with another five listing the specials and promotions currently available, many of which he'd made up on the spot, knowing full well that they were of no interest to his addressee.

"That won't be necessary," an infuriated Dumbledore managed at last, "I was merely hoping to see Sirius Black. I understand he visited you earlier and, as I haven't seen him leave, I hoped to catch him before he did so if you could point me in his direction I will speak to him when he concludes his current dealings."

"I'm afraid, Mr er…" the goblin looked at him.

"Dumbledore," the old wizard sighed in resigned frustration, "Albus Dumbledore."

"Well Mr Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore," Bogrod continued, face not revealing the masses of fun he was having dealing with the pompous mage, "as I was saying I'm afraid Mr Black will not be able to meet you here."

"Oh come now," Dumbledore turned conciliatory, "I can appreciate that he has business in the bank and would be happy to wait outside the room for him to finish, but it is imperative that I speak to him before he leaves."

"He's already left," his teller revealed, seeing the line of impatient wizards building behind Dumbledore. "He flooed directly away from here."

Dumbledore looked crestfallen; he tried his last hope. "Do you know where he flooed to?"

"No," the goblin was annoyed now and not afraid to show it, "and even if I did I wouldn't be able to tell you. Client confidentiality you know. Now, if there's nothing else Mr Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore, I have a lot of people to deal with," he nodded over Albus's shoulder; Dumbledore turned and saw the long, angry queue. He frowned but, knowing the intransigent nature of the goblin, backed down and wished him good day.</pre>

<pre>"WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN YOUNG MAN?" shouted a voice that Harry recognized immediately. Sat at the staff table, a clean and sharp Sirius Black, with shorter hair and trimmed beard, next to a also clean and quite sharp Remus Lupin, rose from his seat.

The silence in the great hall was absolute. Daphne recognized to man who shouted from the memory Harry had showed her hours before as being Sirius Black.

"I guess you're a free man, then?" asked Harry, looking at the man in shock "That was unusually fast."

"Obviously. Given the evidence supplied by your parent's will, the DMLE and the ministry had no other choice than declare me an innocent man." replied Sirius, not noticing the looks Dumbledore gave him "I've been a free man since nine o'clock last evening. However, don't try to change the subject, where have you been? Imagine my disappointment when I arrived Hogwarts around noon, intending to give you the good news personally and you were nowhere to be found? Not only that, a young lady was also missing, someone you have been very close for the past weeks." Sirius said, although under the concern, there was also amusement "Where have you been for the whole day?"

Harry just glared at the man, hiding the bulk of his anger behind his mask.

"You intended to give me the good news around noon when the paper arrives around eight?" asked Harry, raising an eyebrow, noticing how Lupin was holding his laughter and Sirius actually looked embarrassed "You got drunk celebrating last night, didn't you? And the hangover was too strong in the morning, to actually get your ass out of bed."

Sirius actually blushed, ignoring the nervous laughter heard around the hall, especially from Remus.

"Don't try to change the subject." admonished Sirius and Harry actually shook his head.

"Glad to see you still have your priorities straight." replied Harry in a sarcastic and cold tone that made almost everyone shiver, even if they didn't understand his meaning, effectively ending the amusement in the hall "Now, if you're done, I'm going to have dinner. If you want to talk to me, we can do it afterwards." Harry said in the same cold, if not worse, glaring to Sirius in the eyes "Although as you can see, I'm fine and I'm glad about you, even if you can't be bothered to send me a message, like you promised... You still remember how to call for Dobby, don't you? You know, house elf, usually hangs around me?" asked Harry sarcastically, with his temper rising. Daphne grabbed Harry by the arm and squeezed it, intending to calm him. It worked and Harry just nodded to their house table, intending to sit with their friends.

Sirius actually sat back in his chair in silence, after feeling his godson's anger towards him and not feeling as happy or proud as he did moments before, trying to think over what he had said that could have angered the teen so much.</pre>

<pre>"This behaviour will not be tolerated, Potter." admonish McGonagall "While it is true that Mr. Weasley cast the first spell, you started the altercation by drawing your wand first. It is equally bad. You will be punished for it, as will be Mr. Weasley."

Harry glared at the older woman with a sneer.

"Very well, than. What is my punishment?" he asked in a cold tone.

"Both you and Mr. Weasley will serve detention with professor Snape." started Dumbledore. To his astonishment, Harry scoffed.

"Brilliant." he mumbled sarcastically, realizing the uncomfortable look Snape gave Dumbledore sideways.

"I am terribly disappointed with you, Harry." said Dumbledore, shaking his head, only to receive a chuckle in reply.

"Don't worry, the feeling is mutual." Harry replied, glaring at the older man and turning his back on the two older professors "Professor Snape, when shall I report to you?"

"Nine." replied the potions professor, attempting to maintain his cool. He was trying really hard. Despite wanting to snap at the boy's arrogance, he decided not to. He still hadn't reported Potter's occlumency, only that the boy knew about him telling the dark lord about the prophecy. Of course, Dumbledore had troubles to believe it...

+

"Potter, I need your help." there, she said it. There was no turning back now, no hiding, no pretending. She had open a door she never wanted open ever. But she did. She admitted he could help her and attempted it. She was also ready to negotiate. He rose an eyebrow, as if he was expecting her to continue. Secretly, he was astonished and overjoyed "I want your help in DADA."

"Any particular reason?" he asked, knowing full well.

"My reasons are my own, Potter." she replied in a cold, sad voice "I can assure you I am not against you and that I need it. I'm willing to pay and negotiate. What do you say?"

Harry pretended to think about it.

I don't care if they are your family or not, they are not going to threatening you again, not if I can help it, my love. Suddenly, he had a brilliant idea.

"Let's make a deal, then. I help you with your DADA problem and you'll help me with all my tournament problems. Do you agree?" he asked, extending her his hand.

Daphne was surprised. Truly. She expected him to ask for much more but she wouldn't complain. More, it was likely that help him with the tournament would be very troublesome.

"Agreed, Potter." she replied, shaking his hand. She didn't noticed it, but Harry did. She had a small smile on her lips.

Yes! Yes! Yes! shouted Harry in his mind, overjoyed.

"By the way, tradition states there is a Yule ball associated with the tournament." Harry said, drawing her attention. "Unless you oppose or would like to go with anyone else, would you like to go with me, according with our agreement?"

Daphne widened her eyes in shock. Then she snorted.

"Well played, Potter, well played."

"I have no idea of what you are talking about." said Harry with a smirk. Daphne did her best to hide a smirk of her own.

"Either there is a lot hidden about you or I have just being played by an amateur. I'd rather believe you are just hiding yourself." she said, looking at his smirk And I think I am very right she thought. "A couple of conditions, then."

"Sure, name them and I'll consider them."

Very well done, Potter. she thought about his wording. He hadn't said yes or no, just that he would consider it.

"You'll need to do your best to win the tournament, you'll get proper robes for you if I don't like yours and you teach me properly." she said, looking at him in the eyes.

"May I ask why you want me to win the tournament?" he asked, rather curious.

She shrugged.

"I can't give you a straight answer, Potter, but I think you can after what I have seen and I personally don't like to not live up to all I can achieve" she said.

That's my girl. Harry thought.

"Besides, like you said, it would crush the dorks and the puffs." she added, making Harry chuckle.

"Very well. I'll do my best to win the tournament, don't worry about my robes, I am already on it and I promise I teach you properly." he said, to which she nodded.

+

"Attention students, there seems to be a problem with our food." said Dumbledore, attracting the attention of everyone "We expect to have it solved in some minutes, please, we expect your patience."

"OK, that's it..." said Harry, closing his book "Dobby?"

The weird house elf appeared next to Harry and they started to talk among themselves, not heard by anyone. Then, Harry's laugh was heard in the entire great hall, silencing everyone. Everyone turned to him, seeing him laughing to hard, almost falling from the bench. He was being supported by the house elf who was himself trying hard not to laugh. He failed, of course and he too started to laugh. Master and elf fell on the floor laughing. The snakes were concerned about Harry and Daphne was even more when she heard Harry saying he couldn't breathe because he was laughing so hard.

"Mr. Potter!" shouted Dumbledore "What is the meaning of this?"

Of course, Harry only laughed harder.

"Tell... tell... oh Merlin, that's hilarious!" said Harry again trying to regain some composure. Everyone was looking at him in shock.

"What the hell, Potter?" asked Parkinson in a shriek while Harry was attempting to control himself by breathing.

"OK... OK... I can do this..." he said and his new friends knew he was really trying hard "I'd like to say that I support the house elves struggle. GO HOUSE ELVES!" and he cracked again.

Again, everyone started to look at him as if he had two or more heads.

"Call him, please. I can't..." he laughed again, this time sitting on the bench.

"Timbler!" called Dobby and a very old house elf appeared before Dobby, who was still laughing, just like his master.

"Timbler, please, can you... explain what is happening?" asked Harry politely, to which the elf nodded.

"Wes house elves are on strike, we are, until the evil one, she who must never be named, the bane of house elves, stops her attempts to free and kill us, poor working Hogwarts house elves."

"What?" someone asked, not really understanding.

"Can you explain, Timbler?" asked Dumbledore, looking at the house elf and looking at the still laughing Harry Potter.

"The evil one keeps dropping clothes for us, poor house elves. One of us touched clothes and was freed from its bond to Hogwarts. Poor Tiby is dying because of it. And she keeps doing it, to kill more of us, poor hard working house elves." Timbler said, in a mixture of sorrow, anger and desperation, enough to bring Harry out of his amusement while everyone was imitating a fish "We even stopped cleaning the red tower but she leaves things everywhere else too. Wes lives in fear."

People were just gaping, looking at the old elf and to the younger elf who stood with his hand on his shoulder. He wasn't laughing any more, neither was Potter. They were both getting angry, if the scowl was any indication.

"Oi, Granger, how does it feel?"he asked, glaring at the Gryffindor "To know that you are killing good and hard working house elves because of your stupidity? Did you even researched about elves? Did you even realized what you were doing by leaving all those clothes all around?" asked an angered Harry Potter as everyone's attention turned to a fearful and red Granger.

"I... I didn't..." she tried, being stopped by Harry.

"No, you didn't, you stupid bint!" hissed Harry "The house elves refuse to work because they are afraid of you! You are almost a master for them, as all of us are. You have power over them and what do you do? You act as the typical m-word person that gives a bad name to all muggleborns. And you muggleborns wonder why you are frowned upon? It's because of people like HER! There are rules in this world, rules that I admit, I was unaware until a couple of months ago. Rules that I attempted to learn. Rules that justify why my mother, a mere muggleborn was appreciated and respected by even the most bigot pureblood. Except Malfoy. But yet, even if they call her a m-word person, some still hold some respect for her, because she attempted to be a part of the world, not change it and make a damn magical copy of the muggle world, destroying centuries of traditions. Try to understand this world and its people before assuming you know what's best to anyone else.

The house elves refuse to clean your tower because they are just afraid to find more clothes, but that wasn't enough, right? You left more clothes all around... and now, the poor house elves are even afraid of leaving the kitchen. Because of you and your damn SPEW! And because they couldn't do anything else, they refused to cook for us, to draw attention to their plight, before you kill them all!" accused Harry, his magic flaring around him, pointing at Granger.

Everyone was impressed by Harry's insight and knowing or not, Harry had just declared himself as neutral in the political game that ruled the wizarding world. Some muggleborns actually took his words to heart.

Everyone turned in anger at Granger, who was crying at the table. There were even some wands drawn.

Dumbledore and McGonagall opted to save Granger and take her with them, leaving a very angry population behind. Timbler vanished, knowing full well that his plight had been heard, eager to tell the good news to his brethren. Harry sat again on the bench.

"Damn, the bint really is stupid." he said "And the house elves, sneaky bastards, they got us really good." He chuckled again. Then Dobby laughed. Slytherin found it amusing and laughed as well, as did Durmstrang and a couple of others. Gryffindor didn't, they had been humiliated enough by Granger.</pre>

<pre>"Do not presume-" Igor froze, pupils shrinking to pinpoints. "What is your family name?" he asked harshly. 'It couldn't be,' he thought desperately. 'There was no way the little monster could have predicted where he'd be, it wasn't possible! It couldn't be possible!'

"Longbottom," Neville replied, still trying to act friendly despite the man's lack of manners.

'It was him!' Igor thought fearfully. The-Boy-Who-Had-Done-The-Impossible-and-Killed-Severus-Snape. A boy, eleven years old, who killed the greatest potions master of Igor's generation, with a POTION! The man began to hyperventilate.

Igor nervously double checked his bubblehead charm and anti-poison ward (stitched into his robes, on the inside with an impervious charm for good measure), as he tried to think of a way to escape the Longbottom assassin.

"You should try the shrimp, it's quite good," Neville suggested in an attempt at small talk.

'He KNOWS!' Igor screamed in his own head. 'How did he know I was allergic to seafood? Mustn't let him get to me.'

"Do you want some water?" Neville asked the silent man innocently. One of the surrounding tarts held up the pitcher for the man to see.

'Must be poisoned,' Igor said in an internal panic. 'No, no, he's much too crafty for that. He's trying to make me nervous.'

"No," Igor said aloud, voice quivering a bit. "I'm fine with my flask."

"Okay, just ask if you want some," Neville said as he started in on the grilled Sherbert Lemon encrusted giant shrimp. "Wow, this is *really* good shrimp!"

Karkaroff could hear his heart pounding in his chest like a 20 heavy metal drum solo. Neville looked up and caught the man's gaze for a moment as the boy took another bite of shrimp.

"Are you okay? You're looking a little pale," Neville commented with a concerned look.

'No! He already got me! How? I was-'

"URGK!" Igor said, clutching his chest as the stress caused his heart to give out, seemingly frozen for a split second before slipping off his chair and onto the ground.

"I don't think he's faking it," Neville's seat said helpfully. Not that she cared, but she figured she owed the man who'd been responsible for her current seating arrangement.

The Healers were on the scene within minutes and, had they been able to breach the wards or had the wards not been up,would have had no trouble saving the man. As it was, the students were forced to watch as the Headmaster of Durmstrang slowly expired in front of them.

IIIIIIIIII

Harry watched in Horrified shock as the Healers tried and failed to revive the world's last Death Eater after the Aurors finally managed to bring down the wards. 'The evil son of a bitch had to survive,' Harry thought desperately. Harry felt like crying when the lead healer shook her head and stood up, prompting the rest to do the same. Harry wanted to scream, to bargain,to beg them to keep trying. He couldn't admit to himself that the man was dead. 'He can't die here, not like this, not if I'm not the one responsible. Neville can't do this to me again!'

"It's not the end of the world, Harry," Susan tried to console the boy. "There are still loads of bad guys you can go after."

"Yeah," Luna agreed. "Not like the United Kingdom's the only place that breeds Dark Wizards."

"It's just . . . just not the same," Harry mumbled, looking almost as depressed as he was feeling. What did he ever do to Neville to deserve this? What did Neville ever do to be so lucky?

"Maybe you could kill Grindelwald?" Hermione suggested, trying to cheer up her best friend.

"Yeah," Susan agreed. "He's still alive, isn't he?"

"Not even Dumbledore managed to kill Grindelwald," Luna added helpfully.

"You're right," Harry said, eyes sparkling. "Let's go!"

"What, now?" Hermione sputtered.

"I'm not gonna give Neville a chance to steal another kill," Harry agreed, shooting a glare at the other boy. Neville is surrounded by a menagerie of girls which now included several from Durmstrang. "Not again."

The End

"Where's the new dark lord?" Harry asked with a sigh while entering the bar. He was really tired of this.

"That'd be Johnny over there," Bruce replied from behind the bar, pointing at a man who was obviously drunk and grinning broadly.

Harry looked at the man who had his arm around a lass with bright red hair and breasts bigger than his head.

"Doesn't look like much of a dark lord."

"Nah, we got him drunk and laid. That usually wipes all thoughts of dark magic from their minds. Between Shelia and some decent lager dark magic loses its appeal."

"What, really?"

"Yeah, takes a lot of repressed sexual urges to become a dark lord and Shelia usually unrepressed them to the point they can't walk. Give him a couple of days to sober up and he'll find a new hobby."</pre>

<pre>"Shame Dobby isn't around," Hermione mused, "I wonder what happened to the little guy."

"You is calling Dobby?" the little elf asked as he popped into the room.

"What are you doing here?" Harry blurted. "I thought you . . ." he trailed off, realizing that he was mixing his memories of the past future with the present past.

"Dobby has been following Harry Potter sir around ever since Harry Potter sir took care of the bad Malfoys," the little elf explained, "Dobby cleans up after Harry Potter sir."

"Cleans up after him?" Susan asked with a grin.

"Harry Potter sir is careless sometimes," the house elf reproached, "left a partial print on bad wizard in Prague and a hair in his flop house in Dubai and . . ."

"We get the picture," Harry interrupted, "thank you, Dobby."

Amelia Bones was having a rather odd Christmas. First her niece had disappeared and then she'd gotten three owls accepting her invitation to a party that she hasn't known she was throwing.

+

"Why couldn't I have fallen for someone else?" Aurora lamented. "Anyone else?"

"We're just lucky I guess," Selene consoled the other woman, shooting a long-suffering look at her husband who was staring at his left hand with a look of utter fascination.

"How many fingers are you supposed to have on your left hand?" he asked intently.

"Five," Selene replied.

A look of horror appeared on her husband's face. "I've got four and a thumb," he said in distress. "Do you think someone hit me with a curse?"

"The thumb counts as a finger," Selene sighed.

"How can it be two things at once?" he demanded. "The logical explanation is that I was hit by a curse. We'll have to go to St. Mungos to get it reversed after the party.

Selene closed her eyes and counted to ten, hopefully he'd be distracted by something later and forget the whole thing. The last thing she wanted to do was to try to explain things to the staff at the hospital, again.</pre>

<pre>Harry James Potter, wizard extraordinaire was simply trying to help out his best mate when he just happened to create havoc once again. It all began on the 14th of August the day of the planned wedding of his best mate Ronald Weasley to Harry's best friend in the world Hermione Jane Granger.

Everything was going perfectly as the minister turned to Hermione and asked do you take this man to be your lawfully wedding husband sealed for all eternity by magical bond?

Hermione though not seeming to be quite as happy as people expected answered "I do."

Of course having asked the bride he turned to Ron and asked do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedding wife sealed for all eternity by magical bond?

Harry standing beside the very nervous Ron watched as Ron stared at the minister in some sort of shock. Giving Ron a nudge in his ribs Harry leaned forward over Ron's shoulder and quite loudly prompted Ron with "I do."

Before anyone knew what was happening a flash of light joined Harry and Hermione for several seconds. As soon as the light faded an elegant piece of parchment appeared above the minister and gently floated into his hand. The minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt looked at the parchment and then quietly declared "I now pronounce you man and wife. Harry you may kiss your bride."

Everyone stood motionless staring at the minister not quite believing what they had heard. Hermione's mother was the first to speak. Looking at the minister she asked "Are you saying that Hermione is married to Harry."

Kings looked at them rather sheepishly while silently muttering to himself, "I knew I should have used their names like they do in the more modern version, damn Molly and her interference." He looked at Helen Granger and said "Yes according to the marriage certificate."

Helen looked truly happy as she almost shouted "Thank you God."

Richard Granger added his piece as he was feeling delighted said "Wonderful, no more moronic manner less slob over for Sunday dinner. Thanks Harry."

...

While back at the Burrow as Ron blamed everyone else for what had happened and not on his freezing up, Every one was either shouting or telling some one off, Molly was swearing she was going to beat him senseless, Luna Lovegood stood at the back of the Burrow and cast several cleaning charms thinking to her self 'anyone testing my wand will not find a petrificus totallus charm. Ron will just have to learn he's mine…..</pre>

<pre>Soon, they walked into a room. Harry was rather surprised to find it was a bathroom. Even more surprised to find there were no urinals. Daphne walked around the bathroom, opening doors to stalls, and obviously looking to see if they were alone.

"This is a girl's bathroom," Harry said, when Daphne walked back over to him.

"Oh, really?" Daphne asked, "I hadn't noticed. What, My Lord. Are you afraid to be seen in a Witches' Bathroom? I chose to bring you in here, because it is the best and closest available room that provides privacy."

"Anybody could walk in here," Harry said.

"Would you feel better if we stepped into a cubicle?" Daphne asked, raising her eyebrows and grinning.

Harry snorted softly. Cheeky little witch. Two could play this game.

"Well, it depends," Harry said, slowly, "The last time I walked out of a cubicle in a witches' bathroom, I had lipstick kiss marks all over my face, and neck. Are you offering to recreate that memory?"

Daphne blinked. "I don't wear lipstick that leaves marks."

Harry laughed. "Nice to meet a girl who can keep up with me. Can we begin the main reason why you dragged me in here? I'd like to get back to my tents."

"Before Gran – Hermione comes looking?" Daphne asked. "Or Mummy?"</pre>

<pre>"... I thought you said he didn't try to hit you with the Killing Curse?"

"Well I dunno!" Harry complained, frustratedly throwing his arms up in the air, "I mean everyone seems to think so and I don't remember that stuff, I mean all I'm saying is maybe it wasn't that Killity Curse thingy but people thinking it was is probably a good thing since it maybe means less people are just gonna poo their pants and fall over when someone yells Arabia Carnival!"

"That's 'Avada Kedavara', Harry." Hermione said, pretty certain she'd got the pronunciation right – she'd read it in 'Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts'.

"And I know that too, Arabia Carnival is me pulling legs and making people snigger same as when I say Mouldy-whatsisface, it's because not being scared of stuff is the first part of working out how you're gonna go stomp all over the stuff you're not letting scare you," Harry declared, still immensely frustrated, "And, hey, if I'm wrong and that Mouldy-whatsisface guy did bounce Killity Curses off my face that means Killity Curses bounce off my face so I don't gotta be scared of 'em anyway, and if I'm right and it was something even weirder and scarier than Killity Curses that bounced off my face that means stuff that makes Killity Curses look like tickling hexes bounces off my face so I don't gotta be scared of Killity Curses anyway because my head is far too awesome for that."

Here Hermione momentarily wondered whether the right term was 'overinflated', then chided herself for being unnecessarily mean.

+

"Are there any warning signs we should be aware of in future?" Snape asked.

"Nah – well, there ain't none anyone's ever written down. Somea the best dragon-handlers get a feelin' when one's gonna do it, but..." and Hagrid shrugged expansively, causing a rather startled ferret to plop out of his sleeve and land in Dumbledore's lemon drop bowl.

"Rubeus, you appear to have mislaid a ferret." Dumbledore said.

The ferret gave Dumbledore a measuring look, then demonstrated itself to in fact be a Jarvey by flipping him off with both forepaws and declaring in a smooth baritone, "Fuck you guv'nor, and your little dog too. And your dear old mum. You wanna piece of me, I'll bite your nadgers off!"

Some ten minutes later, the foul-mouthed (and unfortunately magic-resistant) mustelid having been retrieved, the group returned to their seats and the subject.

+

"Who are the ten most powerful beings in the Wizarding World?" Hermione asked, pre-empting Harry's incoming rant.

"In order, Emperor Ling of the Han. King Hector the Second of the Australasian Union of Magic. Whoever is at any given time dubbed 'The Dark Lord', emphasis on the 'The'. Albus Dumbledore in his capacity as Chairman of the International Confederacy of Wizards. Comrade-Chairman Yuri Valiseyovich of the Union of Soviet Socialist Wizarding Republics. President Running Bull of the North American Confederation of Magic. Sheik Mohammed al'Azhared of the Greater Arabian Wizarding Union. Count Vladimir Dracula. The Maharajah of Roanpoor. Emperor Julius Medici the Twelfth of Rome. And the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of Black and Black Heavy Industries, currently one Narcissa Malfoy."

"What sorta money are we talking about?" Harry immediately asked.

"Black and Black control fully three percent of the economy of the Wizarding World, and I do not mean Wizarding Britain when I say that; I mean Wizarding Earth. Their annual profits make those of Gringotts look like a drop in the bucket. Between the Han, the Confederation, Roanpoor, and the USSWR, one may count fully one third of the magical population of this world, split roughly evenly between the four, with related hitting power and industrial capacity. Count Dracula – not the caricature about which Stoker wrote, the real thing – is widely regarded as the most magically powerful being ever known to exist; he makes you seem a squib. The Australasians control three of the four most powerful places of magic in the world; Ayers Rock, the Great Barrier Reef, and Roturua. The Emperor of Rome is in control of most of southern Europe and through it more than half of those Wizarding industrial facilities outside of the Big Four. And Albus holds veto upon any efforts to pervert international magical law, a power he has exercised with great enthusiasm. As for the Dark Lord, the nearest there is to a current claimant had an 'unfortunate' encounter with your forehead over a decade ago."

+

"So. The 'boy-who-lived'. Ha! The Boy-Who-Won't-Live-Much-Longer!" the noseless man declared.

"Who the dickens are you, what do you think you're doing, how'd you find here to get in and which reprobate gave you a nosectomy?" Harry asked, justifiably put out.

"Are you an imbecile, boy?" the noseless man snarled. "I Am Lord Voldemort! I am here to finish what I started eleven years ago! And of course I found you, I am the Dark Lord! Nothing is outside of my reach!... what in Salazar's name is a nosectomy?"

"Huh? Nah, you can't be Moldevorts, he splattered himself when he bounced that Arabia Carnival thingy off my face," Harry stated; he wasn't buying it, regardless of what Dumbledore said, "And since you found my lair you can't be half as stupid as someone who managed to splatter himself trying to kill a baby. Hey, and since getting your appendix took out is an appendixectomy I guess getting your nose took off is a nosectomy."

"... why am I discussing noses with the Potter brat?" the man who claimed to be Voldemort muttered. "Feh! Claim what you like, that mudblood bitch of a mother of yours did... something! A ritual! It caused my curse to rebound, not your face! And as I have progressed further along the path to immortality than any other all it succeeded in doing was the destruction of my body, which with the aid of my most excellent assistant Professor Quirrel who unfortunately perished in the process, I have regained!"

"No, onea my friends has a photo of the mess. Moldevorts was splattered all over the wall and the floor and the ceiling, I Mean He Went Splat! And when I splat things – well, or when my forehead splats things – They Stay Splatted!"

	"I have only one thing left to say to you, foolish brat; Avada Kedavera!"

	Harry only just had time to start saying, "Hey!" before the curse hit.

	"And now," Voldemort declared, turning to Hermione, "For you, mudblood. You have the honour to be the second slain by me in this, my new-"

	"You've got no idea how much that stings!" Harry loudly declared, sitting back up from where he'd fallen over. This was sufficiently strange to throw Voldemort off track mid-monologue.

	"... actually, I have." the Dark Lord said. "By the way, Avada Kedavera."

He turned back to the quivering Hermione.

"Where was I? Ah yes, you-"

"I'm done talking to you, nobody just-" the Boy-Who-Wouldn't-Freaking-Die declared, popping back up.

"Avada Kedavera goddamnit."

"OW! Nobody just comes in here going-"

"AVADA KEDAVERA!"

"-Arabia Carnival and-"

"AVADA KEDAVERA! WILL YOU PLEASE JUST DIE ALREADY?!"

"-Threatening my damsels!"

"AVADA KEDAVERA, AVADA KEDAVERA, AVADA KEDAVERA!"

The Boy-Who-Kept-Popping-Back-Up seemed to be staying down this time, so the highly irritated Dark Lord once again returned his attention to Hermione.

"Finally." he said. "As I was saying,"

That was when an enormous set of teeth descended on him; Harry, his piece said, had gone dragon-form and gone for the bite.

Harry chewed, swallowed, belched, then said, "Huh."

Hermione, who'd managed to get her teeth unclenched, let out a distinctly shellshocked-sounding squeak.

"S'funny. I didn't expect enemy to taste like pork." Harry continued. "Wonder who that was? Sure can't have been- ohboy, dragon gas."

With that, he whirled round, stuck his tail and backside out over the lip of his lair, and released what must have been the most epic fart in known history.

After all, farts are usually composed of methane or some such rancid gas, not screaming disembodied horribly-traumatised-due-to-just-having-passed-through-a-dragon's-digestive-tract shades of Dark Lords.</pre>

<pre>The group again switched to safer topics as they walked into the Transfiguration classroom.

"What a pretty kitty," Luna squealed. She picked up the cat she knew to be her Professor and began caressing it. "Would you like some tuna kitty?"

"I think I've got some catnip," Susan offered with a grin.

"Why are you carrying catnip?" Hermione asked oddly.

"The same reason I have tuna," Luna answered for her friend, "in case we run into a kitty."

"Oh . . . well, in that case I just happen to have some cream with me."

"I wonder when McGonagall will get here?" Harry asked as the bell rang, doing his best to conceal his amusement.

"Maybe we went to the wrong classroom," Luna mused, "and the Hufflepuffs too."

"Maybe," Harry agreed. 'Or maybe the Professor is stoned out of her mind and eating tuna while guzzling milk.' "Bit of a glutton isn't she?"

With a regal glare, the cat strode out of the room. Pausing only to send a glare over her shoulder at the son of James and Lily.

"I think you angered the kitty," Luna said with a pout.

"I think I'm gonna die if I don't get to laugh soon," Harry choked. "Why didn't you tell me you were going to do that."</pre>

<pre>Neville frowned. "Or they might be trying to kill me."

Albus merely shrugged. While he knew Neville was wrong, it would be interesting to watch the boy's actions around the Ilvermorny Champion, his family and the delegates. If Neville discovered he was wrong, Albus would simply say 'I told you so'. So he found no fault there.

"Mr. Longbottom," Albus said, "Professor Moody has volunteered to train you for the tournament."

"I have my own tutors," Neville said. "Gran, Uncle Algie, and others. They'll be of more help."

"But they're not readily available," Albus said, "Professor Moody is. And, as I said, he was already volunteered. As you know, he's an ex-Auror. He is the Defense Professor -"

"One of my Defense Professors tried to kill me," Neville said, "Another one was a complete fraud. I'm not very trusting with them. Another might have been flirting with me."

"Neville," Dumbledore admonished.

"Alright, probably not," Neville said, "But you can't deny what she did with that Hufflepuff. The proof is in the baby they had this summer. And the wedding my Gran couldn't help but gossip about with her friends. She didn't even go! She just read it in Witch Weekly!"

Albus cleared his throat, stopping Neville. He didn't want to be reminded of that whole fiasco. Never before had Riddle's DADA Curse done that to a Professor to remove them from the post before! Thank god it was an adult being impregnated by a student, and not the other way around, with a Professor – like Lockhart – impregnating a student!

"I trust Professor Moody, Neville," Albus said. "You should too."

"I plan to write to my Gran anyway," Neville said, "I'll get her advice. If she says Professor Moody can help me, then I'll trust her."

Albus sighed. Neville was supposed to be trusting him, more than his Gran!</pre>

<pre>Orion glared down at his eldest, a bit nonplused by the fact that it seemed to have no effect on the boy. "Well," he barked, breaking five minutes of silence. "What do you have to say for yourself?"

"About what, father?" the boy asked, apparently confused by the question.

"About the fact that you've chosen to shame our house by allowing the hat to place you in Gryffindor," he allowed his voice to drop to a hiss. Depressingly, it seemed to have as much effect on the boy as his glare.

"Shame?" Sirius repeated the word, looking confused. "But . . . but I was just following mother's advice."

"Your mother advised you to seek placement in the lion's house?" he asked in disbelief. This conversation was not going the way he'd expected it to. He'd expected to be facing either a sullen or a remorseful boy. Not . . . not this.

"Yup," Sirius agreed proudly. "She said Slytherin was the best place to find a proper wife, that Ravenclaw would do if I could not find one in Slytherin, that Hufflepuffs were a bunch of unimportant plodders, and that Gryffindor was full of loose slags that would do anything to anyone for two knuts."

"You asked to be placed in Gryffindor because your mother said it was filled with scarlet women?" Orion repeated dumbly.

"Yup," Sirius agreed. "Only . . ."

"Yes?"

"Only, I think mother's information was wrong."

"Oh?" he perked up, hoping to hear something that would give him the leverage he needed to get his son into a proper house.

"For one thing, it looks like Slytherin's full of bum-bandits," the boy said conspiratorially.

"It's full of what?"

"Bum bandits," Sirius replied. "I heard some of the seventh years talking about it on the train. It's why I told that hat to put me anywhere but Slytherin. I mean, I guess it's find if that's the sort of thing you like, but it's not the sort of thing I like."

"Do you know what a bum-bandit is, son?" He wasn't sure what answer he wanted to hear.

"The same seventh years explained it to me," the boy replied with a nod.

"I see." And he did, looked like he should have taken more of an interest in the boy's upbringing. "Do I need to explain to you the importance of not relying on rumor to make decisions?"

"I didn't, father, I spent five minutes observing Lucius Malfoy. He spends all his time in the company of two other boys and takes more care of his hair than any ten of the girls combined."

"I see." He hated to sound like a broken record but he was finding it hard to process everything his son was saying.

"She was also wrong about Hufflepuff," Sirius continued, looking a bit subdued.

"In what way?"

"The girl with the biggest bosom at Hogwarts is in Hufflepuff," Sirius replied. "I was gonna ask the hat to put me there until I found out that she was Headgirl so she has her own suite."

One spot of bad luck averted. As bad as the shame of a son being sorted into Gryffindor was, Hufflepuff would have been infinitely worse.

"Shouldn't have second guessed myself," Sirius sighed. The boy reached into his pocket and pulled out a parchment covered in complicated equations.

"What's this?"

"Proof that Hufflepuff girls have the biggest Hufflepuffies in the school on average."

"What do your cousins have to say about this?"

"Not much since I lost two of them," Sirius admitted. "Sometimes you play the odds, sometimes the odds play you."

"Exactly how can you lose a cousin?" Perhaps the muggleborn notions on the dangers of inbreeding were not quite as misguided as he had thought them to be. It was a matter he was going to have to give careful consideration.

"Well, I suppose Andy wasn't so much lost as traded away," Sirius said thoughtfully. "Bella definitely was though."

"You traded your cousin Andromeda?" The man made a mental note to spend more time with his younger son to be sure the lad was being brought up right. The best way to prove the muggleborn wrong was to show them that nurture was far more important that nature.

"It was the only way I could confirm a key piece of research data," Sirius explained.

"What research data?"

The boy pulled a bra out of his pocket and held it up to show that it was of a truly legendary cup size. "That Amelia Bones is all natural."

"You traded Andromeda for a used bra?"

"No, father, that would have been silly," Sirius laughed. Educated by how the conversation had been going so far, his father just braced himself for the next shoe to drop. "I traded her for continued access to the Hufflepuff dorms."

"What about Bellatrix?"

"Lost her in a game of exploding snap with one of the first year Slytherins," Sirius sighed. "But it wasn't my fault, father, I had the second best possible hand."

"Who had the best?"

"Severus Snape," Sirius replied.

"That is not a pureblood name."

"Half-blood from the Prince family, but he knows more about dark magic than most of the seventh years so Bella's happy." Sirius grinned. "He's also really good at Potions. The professor says he had the potential to be a master some day."

"Oh?" Orion perked up a bit, better than it could have been he supposed.

"And when that happens, I'll contact him and offer to take Bella back for the low price of everything he owns and fifty percent of his lifetime earnings," Sirius said happily. "Bella's such a crazy bitch that he's already offered to give me everything he owns. I told him that he didn't have anything I wanted yet and that he needed to work hard to earn enough to make it worth my while."

Orion pinched the bridge of his nose. "Don't say rude things about your cousins. Dare I ask what misfortune has befallen Narcissa?"

"She's been hiding in the Gryffindor girls' dorms so I haven't been able to use her in my plans yet, father."

"Exactly why has she been doing that?"

"James Potter called dibs on one of the muggleborn first year girls and he says that means I can't sneak into their dorm. I disagree but I've agreed not to until after we have a chance to argue the issue before the Wizengamot and get an official ruling."

+

"Do you remember telling him that Gryffindor was full of loose women that would do anything to anyone for two knuts?"

"What of it?"

"Sirius decided that he liked the idea of spending the next seven years surrounded by loose women," Orion explained. The wand was no longer pointed between his eyes. "He also wished me to pass on that your information is a bit out of date as none of the girls have taken him up on any of his offers so far and that far from being the house of plodders, Hufflepuff is now the house of top heavy girls."</pre>

<pre>"I'll make sure he's in a good mood before I tell him," Harry promised, "I'll let him win a couple more games."

"Sure," she teased, "you'll let him win."

Harry stuck his tongue out at her.

Ron was stunned when Harry delivered his news. He didn't seem upset, just very, very surprised (not least as he assumed, like Harry had, that Hermione and Krum were a couple). The advantage of this was, despite his chess set's best efforts and advice, Ron was suitably distracted for Harry to actually beat him.

"I thought you were going to let him win," Hermione reminded him as Ron trudged off to bed, more upset about losing at chess than his two friends going on a date.

"Oh yeah," the boy-who-lived grinned guiltily.</pre>

<pre>"Headaches?" La Pantera's ears perked up. "His head hurt when you touched him tonight. Did you mean to do that?"

The glowing red eyes narrowed. "No, I did not. It did not hurt me, but it still hurt him. But that does not explain why I couldn't kill him."

"No, it doesn't. If the ritual had failed, it should have gone the other way. Grrr, I'll need to try some more diagnostic spells."

"Very well. Proceed."

La Pantera waved her knife over him in various ways, casting even deeper spells than she had used to design the ritual—spells that, so far as Voldemort could tell—assessed the condition of his magic, his body, and his soul in ways he had barely studied in the past. It all seemed to be going normally at first, but then, she must have encountered something shocking because she stopped and started shouting. "¡¿Siete?! ¡Siete planos de exfoliación!" Seven cleavage planes, she said. "You told me you only had six horcruxes, not seven!"

"What are you talking about, woman? I have only six horcruxes."

"Not according to my spell. Your soul is torn in seven places, and that means seven horcruxes. Eight pieces. That's incredibly unstable! I told you making that last horcrux was a bad idea. This is exactly why I only made one of them. You're lucky you didn't shatter what's left of your soul and lose all sense of self! And then where would you be? Trapped in whichever fragment had the largest piece—"

"Enough!" Voldemort roared, drawing his wand on her. "This is impossible! I made five horcruxes before my body was destroyed. I had planned to make the sixth with Potter, but that failed, and the sixth is now Nagini."

"Wait, with Potter?" she said. "You began the ritual before you went to kill him as an infant?"

"Of course I did."

La Pantera responded with a long string of curses in Aztec before she collected herself enough to explain: "¡Idiota! Have you studied dark magic at all? It's the intent to murder that splits the soul for the ritual! The sacrifice only powers it. When your Killing Curse reflected and stuck you, it provided enough power to complete the ritual and break off the soul piece, which then attached itself to Potter."

"What?!" Voldemort hissed.

"That's why you couldn't kill Potter," she said. "He had two souls in him. You just destroyed your own horcrux!"

A moment later, La Pantera regretted for the first time making Voldemort immune to fire, as the air temperature rose to scalding hot in seconds.

"Uh-oh," she said.

She Apparated far, far away a moment before an inhuman scream ripped from Voldemort's throat and the room was engulfed in flames.</pre>

<pre>I miss my hi-tops." Andi bemoaned.

"I'm sure they'll turn…up." Annabeth said, seeing the blue hi-tops sitting a bit too innocently by the door, "Well, seems Lady Aphrodite heard you."

	"See?"

"Thank you!" Andi cheered as she went up to them, "I haven't even gotten to draw on them yet." She grinned.

	"Oh I think not!" Aphrodite said scandalized. "Drawing on shoes! The nerve!"

The shoes disappeared.

"Oh come on!"

	"Drawing on shoes is inexcusable."

	"I dunno, I think it shows the creative side of her," said Apollo with a smile.

	"The dramatic side, you mean?" Poseidon asked with a smirk, making Zeus growl.

Annabeth giggled as she watched Andi argue and bargained to the air as the shoes kept coming back and disappearing until Andi agreed not to draw on them.

	Apollo shook his head in disapproval while Aphrodite smiled smugly.

But she called her Love Goddess ancestor stingy for blocking creative individuality.

	"The nerve!"

	"I'm with the kid on that one," said Apollo.

The shoes left again and Andi mumbled a sorry.

	Aphrodite nodded and pouted. Couldn't the girl see that fashion is made the way it was for a reason?

As they walked to the store, Andi was hugging the blue shoes for dear life, fearing they would disappear once more.

The Goddess of Love may have won the battle, but not the war for Andi's sense of fashion!

+

"Personally," Mr. D continued, "I couldn't care less, but congratulations. Also, I should tell you that we have two new campers today. Peter Johnson and Amanda Edwards."

	"You know, when someone else's name is called as well, it isn't so bad," said Percy.

	"I knew you'd come around one day, Peter," said Dionysus. Percy immediately frowned; he just said that being singled out like that was annoying.

Chiron murmured something.

"Er, Percy Jackson and Andi Evans," Mr. D corrected. "That's right. Hurrah, and all that.

+

"Only the Oracle can determine." Chiron stroked his bristly beard. "Nevertheless, both of you are correct. Your fathers are having their worst quarrel in centuries. They are fighting over something valuable that was stolen. To be precise: a lightning bolt."

	"His favorite toy," said Hades with a smirk.

	"It isn't a toy!"

	"All right, collectable then," said Poseidon with a smile of his own.

Percy laughed nervously. "A what?"

Andi's eyes widened, "No, are you serious?" she demanded as she knew what was taken instantly.

Andi knew the stories; her father had a weapon, a lightning bolt, his most prized tool along with the shield Aegis, that has been in many stories. Her older sister in fact had a copy of the famed shield that could scare monsters and demigods alike.

	Thalia smiled at the mention of her shield. She still carried the bracelet around her wrist, though had few moments of using it since obtaining her bow.

"Do not take this lightly," Chiron warned to Percy. "I'm not talking about some tinfoil-covered zigzag you'd see in a second-grade play. I'm talking about a two-foot-long cylinder of high-grade celestial bronze, capped on both ends with god-level explosives."

"How does he lose that thing?!" Andi asked herself in a whisper, voice full of disbelief. Did he leave it beside his golden toilet or something?

	The two elder brothers of the now red-faced king burst into laughter alongside their nephews and the demigods that struggled to contain themselves. Zeus' nostrils flared in anger as he glared at each person who laughed.

"Oh." Percy said dumbly.

"Zeus' master bolt," Chiron said, getting worked up now. "The symbol of his power, from which all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first weapon made by the Cyclopes for the war against the Titans, the bolt that sheered the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his throne; the master bolt, which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like firecrackers."

"And it's missing?" Percy asked with a gulp.

"Stolen," Chiron said.

"By who?"

	"Wait for it," said Percy after he had calmed down from his laughter.

"By whom," Chiron corrected. "By you." He said pointing to Percy.

	"Officially, worst moment at camp ever," said Percy with a sigh. It truly was because it marked the beginning of a long and hard four years.

Percy mouth fell open.

Andi blinked, a chuckle escaping her quirked up lips, "We are talking about Baywatch here, right?" Percy couldn't steal anything if he tried, she knew, she dared him a few times. And in those times, found it funny as he failed to try and pull a Cabin Eleven.

	Percy sighed and hung his head.

	Consolingly, Hermes said, "Hey on the bright side, if you ever do go to jail, it won't be for theft!"

	It really didn't raise much spirits.

"At least"-Chiron held up a hand-"that's what Zeus thinks. During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: 'Mother Rhea always liked you best,'

	"Well she did," said Poseidon with a glare.

Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,'

	"They certainly are," said Zeus, returning his brother's glare.

	"Are not."

	"Are to."

	"Are not!"

	"Are to!"

	"Are-"

	"Would you both shut up and quick acting like children or would you like me to treat you like them?" Hestia asked, her eyes narrowed in irritation. The two brothers became silent at their sister's words.

et cetera. Afterward, Zeus realized his master bolt was missing, taken from the throne room under his very nose. He immediately blamed Poseidon.</pre>

<pre>"What happened next?"

"They hit Potter with one of the unforgivables," he replied.

"Which one?"

"I don't know."

"How can you not know?" Amelia asked with a frown.

"Because I saw them cast several more throughout the rest of the fight and I saw all three connect more then once," Greengrass replied. "He shrugged off the crucio like it was nothing, wasn't slowed by the imperio, and I'm not sure he even noticed when he was hit by the killing curse. It was like something out of a legend."

+

"Albus," Augusta began. "We received yesterday a copy of the Potters' wills as well as supporting documentation from the goblins on the instructions of Lord Harry Potter. Would it surprise you to know that both Lily and James made it very clear that under no circumstances was Harry to be left with Petunia or Vernon Dursley? Or that Lily made it very clear that Petunia was not a blood relation? That she. Lily, had been adopted?"

Dumbledore's face went whiter than his beard. He had assumed that Petunia was the blood sister of Lily and that as Lily was a loving person that her sister would share her same character and attributes. "Are you sure of this?"

"Goblins do not lie, Chief Warlock."

He hung his head. "I regret that I did not know this."

+

By this, McGonagall had risen in her seat to face Dumbledore. His face had gone white at the force of the words she was addressing to him.

"You deceived me. You deceived many others. You took the child of James and Lily and turned him into an isolated, lonely and now clearly suicidal child who is finally finding his purpose in confronting the demon who has been haunting his life.

"You are the one who is the dark lord in his life, not Voldemort!"

Before anyone could react, Amelia brought the gavel down. "Committee hearing adjourned."</pre>

<pre>When Harry saw the two potioning students eat, he noticed a haze appear in their eyes. They started to squirm in their seats and cast glances at the head table every minute or so, ignoring their friends. At eight Snape left the head table to give the Slytherin their class schedules. When he approached the first potions student, the male, he had no way to defend himself with all the schedules in his hands. The student stood up abruptly when Snape handed him his time table and launched himself at the man, kissing him directly on the lips. The whole hall was frozen in shock which was broken when the other potioned student screamed. "That's my man you bastard!" and proceeded to draw her wand and sent a curse at the other student. The curse missed the student but hit Snape, who was trying to push the male student away at the time, saving the student and putting himself in the line of fire. Snape sprouted boils all over his face where the spell hit and fell to the ground. At this point the first student had drawn his wand and sent a spell back at the second student for daring to attack his love. The spell missed and Harry put up a shield to protect the innocent students in the hall. At this time the first teacher had arrived and bound both students in ropes. Both student were screaming at each other and professing their love to Snape the whole time.</pre>

<pre>"Miss Susan?"

"Yes, Evie?" Susan looked at a young female elf.

"Your Aunt say she needed to leaves for the Ministry"

"Did she say why?"

"No, Miss"

"Leave a note?"

"Only that she be wantings you three in different rooms to sleep"

"Now that raises the prospect of fun" giggled Hannah.

#

"HELP ME!" Susan wailed. "THE DARK LADY HAS GOT ME!"

"BE QUIET, YOU FOOL, OR I WILL MAKE YOU PAY DEARLY!"

"I'M COMING SUSAN – SHE GOT LOADS OF HER MINIONS ATTACKING ME!" Harry called out.

"FOR THE GLORIES OF THE EMPIRE!" a number of high pitched voices could be heard – followed by some thudding noises and groans of pain.

"Oh shite…" the two Aurors that had returned with Madam Bones took out their wands and charged in with blasting hexes on the front door and cast detection charms revealing where the entire household was. Finding that everybody was in the living room, the pair and Madam Bones went charging in with binding curses and stunners.

"You know" said one of the Aurors, "I'm getting too old for this crap" and the three looked at what they had found. Hannah, who had been stunned and tied with thick rope and chain, was wearing her long black cloak, an old battered witches hat, a liquorice wand in her hand and had been in the middle of tying up a dazed and confused Susan in an armchair. The pair were surrounded by around a dozen House Elves wearing either black or gold t-shirts – each carrying weapons of mass terror… cushions and pillows. Madam Bones looked to her left to see Harry flanked by two elves wearing gold t-shirts holding a number of cushions in each hand by their corners. It was clear that the gold shirts were Harry's forces and the black shirted elves were members of the so called evil empire. As for the boy himself, Harry was wearing a red cape, blue t-shirt and trousers and had frozen in the act of using what appeared to be one of Susan's bras as a multiple rocket launcher. Each bra cup held tiny paint balls, and Susan's Aunt could see the intensity of the 'firepower' from the gold shirted side on the walls, some books and a stunned house elf.

"What is the meaning of this?" demanded the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

"Susan was taken by the evil Badger Empire" Harry said. "Team Gold Shirt launched a counter attack on Dark Lady Han Han the First, but her minions, Team Black Shirt, countered attacked. I was just in the middle of sending in some of my allies with extra cushion supplies when you came in" and then an odd look passed over his face as he watched the Aurors revive the stunned Hannah and house elves. "Dark Lady Han Han?"

"Yes, Super Harry?" Hannah replied as she dusted herself off.

"I propose an alliance" Harry said. "We get together as allies against the evil Ministry Threesome"

"Agreed" Hannah swept her cloak round in a dramatic manner and then tossed her liquorice wand at the closer of the two Aurors – hitting her right between the eyes. "Attack the Aurors, my minions… Show no mercy – then plunder their castles for treasure and sweets"

"ALL HAIL DARK LADY HAN HAN!" the elves picked up their cushions and pillows before charging as one great wedge.

"Team Gold Shirt – attack!" Harry yelled and his elves formed a second wedge and waded into battle. The Aurors were both veterans of the war, had served for twenty seven years and did the only thing they could do with the odds.

"WE SURRENDER!" they dropped to their knees and held up their hands. A few of the elves took them into custody whilst the remainder of the combined force surged onwards and attacked Madam Bones. Within seconds, the experienced and highly trained witch was covered by elves hitting her with pillows and cushions.

"Ah, Amelia…" whatever a newly arrived Fudge was going to say next was cut off as a company of elves broke away from the main group and swamped him and his protection detail. As they went down, one of them accidentally hit their emergency beacon which caused the rest of the DMLE to turn out to Madam Bones's house

"Do you think we should say anything?" Harry said to the girls.

"Naaaaaah" replied Susan and charged into the fray with whirling pillows.

"What she said" Hannah agreed and hurried after her friend.

"Oh well… More sweets, I suppose!" Harry shrugged

#

"Bye" the Hufflepuff Three, as the rest of the DMLE had dubbed them, waved goodbye to the last of the Aurors before carefully carrying their treasure inside the house. The eventual capture of most of the senior positions of the Ministry of Magic by three first year students and some house elves was destined to go down in the history books. None of the prisoners had been released until they had each received a ton in weight of sweets and fizzy drinks.

"Might I suggest" said a flustered and worn out Madam Bones, "That you start on them after you have had dinner?"

"Dinner!" the three said in union and hurried upstairs to store their ill-gotten gains. They came down to a huge feast of all of their favourite dinner foods, orange juice, cola, lemonade and all manner of things. As they talked, told jokes and otherwise enjoyed each other's company, Hannah looked up to see Harry with a sad sort of puzzling and questioning look on his face.</pre>

<pre>"First of all, why didn't you question why Hagrid had my key? Second, why did it take you years to even start to think something was wrong?"

"You have to understand that it was a long time ago. Everything was going on at the same time, so when Albus Dumbledore came in with a will that said you were to go to your Aunt and Uncle, we simply ignored the concerns we had over the death of two insignificant humans who would stupid enough to not protect themselves"

"THEY WERE MY PARENTS!" Harry launched himself over the table and pounded his small fists into the Goblin's face. Hannah and Susan looked at the fight, then at each other, and then shrugged before jumping over the table and joining in themselves.

"BANZAI!" they called out. As an alarm sounded for assistance, Madam Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, froze in a mixture of horror and surprise – wishing she'd become an artist or something. Goblins poured in with mean looking pikes and swords at the ready – stopping to see three pre-teens battering a Senior Accounts Manager to death.

"Do we have any rules or procedures for this?" asked one guard.

"Well they're not using wands or magic" said another, "So I'm not sure what to do?"

"Help me!" squealed Swordedge.

"What on earth is going on here?" asked a deep and powerful voice.

"Three humans are attacking a Senior Accounts Manager" the first guard spoke to Ragnuk, King of the Goblins in the UK.

"Are you incompetent fools going to stand there?"

"Well they are not using magic" the guard replied.

"And they are children" put in the second.

"If you want something doing…" the King sighed and rolled up the sleeves of his jacket before wading in and grabbing the three children in one hand and Swordedge with the other. Both sides tried to hit each other in some sublime comedy cartoon fight. "What is going on here?" Ragnuk asked.

"These humans attacked me – I demand their heads!" Swordedge flailed his arms towards Harry.

"He insulted my parents" Harry spat back.

"And who are your parents, boy?"

"James and Lily Potter – he called them insignificant and stupid"

"Oh, I see… I can not allow you to attack my employees, but I can not allow my employees to insult clients and their deceased family members" Ragnuk turned to look at Swordedge. "Is this true?" he asked.

"Yes, but I told only the truth"

"And do you think that it is wise to tell the orphaned son of people he most likely saw killed their parents were stupid and insignificant?"

"I regret some of my word choices, but the facts speak for themselves"</pre>

<pre>"Anyway," Lily said, "Give me a report on the living arrangements, Sirius."

"It is just as we discussed before we made the trip, Lily," Sirius said. "Five wizarding tents – which, as you know, means they're bigger on the inside than they are on the outside. The closest tent is the House Potter tent."

"House Potter?" Harry asked.

"It is where you, Rose, your mother, and Remus and I will be sleeping," Sirius explained. "As for the older students – well, we have three girls and six boys. So that was pretty easy to divide them up. One girl for every two guys."

"Sirius!" Lily growled.

"Alright, alright, of course I'm joking!" Sirius said, hastily, "Keep your panties on! One of the tents is for the girls. Then two of the other tents have three boys a piece. And the final tent is the classroom tent, complete with the portable library, and three separate small classrooms. Each residential tent has three bedrooms. While the other tents have one bed per bedroom, the House Potter tent has two beds per room. Remus and I have claimed a room; Lily, you and Rose claim another room, and Harry will get another room for himself. Of course, pup, you are most welcome to invite someone into your room -"

"Sirius!" Lily growled in an I'm-warning-you voice.

"Lily, your son is fourteen," Sirius said, "And there's a really good chance he'll become Champion. The girls will flock – ow! Merlin, woman!"

Harry snickered. Lily had whipped out her wand and had hit Sirius in the chest with a Stinging Hex. His godfather would never change.

"Behave, or the next hex goes below the belt," Lily warned Sirius.

Sirius winced and crossed his legs. Harry couldn't blame him.</pre>

<pre>A number of things happened in the aftermath of that memorable event.

Professor Flitwick debated assigning a three foot essay on 'Why we must never summon Great Old Ones at Dinnertime, or for that matter, Ever,' but in the end went out and got very drunk instead.

St Mungo's had a record influx of patients, many of whom developed incurable phobias of anything with tentacles or a fishy smell.

Within a month, about three hundred and seventy-five people, almost all of them male, mostly from wealthy pure-blood families, and in critical places in government and society, mysteriously vanished, often from locked rooms. The only trace found was the occasional scent of some dark sea, which made people who smelled it have weird nightmares they were very grateful not to remember on awakening.

Harry Potter had some very odd dreams, one of which caused him to wake up with a memory of some sudden pain, only to find his scar bleeding a little. Over the next few weeks it healed up nicely and was soon barely visible.

The goblins never spoke of what happened in a particular vault, but had to replace a dragon which had gone catatonic.

He-who-must-not-be-named was never heard of again.

And, oddly enough, that was the last time anyone ever teased Luna Lovegood.</pre>

<pre>"Magister Maximus Harry James Potter. Today at six-forty Ante Meridiem, we have detected that you performed a class-zero act of Pure Necromancy, and have created a fully sentient above-golem-class construct out of pure magic. This act, the highest act possible in the Arts of Necromancy, has classified you for the title, Magister Maximus, within the ranks of Necromancy. As the last remaining Necromancer, you have now attained its ultimate rank. Should any new Necromancers arise, you are allowed to call yourself their leader, and they must, in turn, swear allegiance to you."

"Necromantic Protocol will remain in effect, its strict policies enforced to the full extent of the laws of the Ministry of Magic of Great Britain, and indeed, the other Magical Governments of the world."

"Your sincerely,

"Mathilda Bagshot, Strange and Unusual Magic Office."

"Magister Maximus, huh?" Ginny said with a smirk in Harry's direction. The boy grunted.

+

Snape's right eye ticked at the American accent. "Speak like normal people, Potter. That American hogwash is making you sound even more like an attention seeking git than you normally are."

"Actually," Harry said, switching instantly to some high-class Oxford accent, "I wonder what the Ministry for Magic would say, should your debasing comments come to their ears. After all, they were quite clear and respectful to me this morning, when they sent me notification of my promotion."

Snape blinked. "As if the Ministry would side with one such as-"

"If not the Ministry, Heer Professor, perhaps the press would be very interested in hearing what I have to say about a certain Death Eater spy in our midst. And I am not talking about that dwaze malloot, Draco Malfoy. I already dealt with him. I am sure Tom Riddle reads the Daily Prophet, just like everybody else."

Snape grew pale. "Are you daft? Saying that out loud..."

+

"Mister Potter!" Snape snarled.

Claudia stepped around him, graceful and forceful, flowing in her stride in a manner that was decidedly inhuman. "Magister – Maximus," she stated, coldly. "Father's name should not be tarnished by the likes of you, vile creature. You shall address him by his proper title, Magister Maximus, as granted to him when reaching the ultimate level of Necromancy, the creation of a fully sentient intelligence. Me."

Snape stood there, gaping for a few seconds, before turned a vile, puce-like purple color Harry remembered seeing on the face of his uncle Vernon. It looked decidedly unhealthy, and he wondered whether Claudia would be able to kill the Potions Master due to inducing cardiac arrest.

"And just what might you be, then?" he snarled back.

Claudia pulled back her shoulders, her spine ramrod straight as she jammed her nose into the air. "I am the Magical Intelligence known as Claudia."

"Probably as useless as Potter-"

In retrospect, Snape knew he should have listened the first time she told him to use Harry's title.

Claudia's right hand made a single, jerking, angry-looking motion, and the very room they were in quivered as the magic responded.

The Snape-sized hole in the wall looked decidedly comical, as if it had run out of a muggle cartoon. The pained groan was a lot less funny, as the Potions Master sounded as if he were in the most excruciating pain.

"Claudia," Harry muttered.

"Yes, Harry?"

"You shouldn't hit a man to cause him pain. You should hit the git so he will stay away from us. Hurting him causes resentment... you should cause him fear instead."

"I have a lot left to learn, Harry," Claudia muttered with a small smile on her lips. "Are you angry with me?" she then asked, actually looking as if she were pouting.

Harry shook his head. "Not angry. Merely explaining a lesson. Besides, it isn't as if Snape didn't deserve it." He then walked to the Snape-sized hole, and peered through it. "It looks as if you broke about half his bones, and he's bleeding quite heavily." He waved his hand. "I stopped the lethal bleeding. Wouldn't want him dying," he said, withdrawing his head, and grinning at Claudia. "Come on, you've got a horcrux to remove from my forehead."</pre>

<pre>"Harry is right, Cho," Luna said, dreamily looking at the Head Girl. "When life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Then sell the lemonade, get a big markup, buy more lemons, make more, and buy a juicer. Then set up a global empire of lemonade stands, and make a fortune!"

As she spoke, getting more and more excited, the other's jaws sunk lower and lower.

"Okay..." Harry muttered, not believing what he just heard. "What she said," he then said, pointing at Luna while looking at Cho.

Luna drew a breath. They all stared at her. "After you achieve a monopoly in Lemonade stands, it's time to break into other markets. Girl Scout Cookies, for instance, would make a great secondary market, to match the lemonade you're selling. You could put a free box of cookies in with every two bottles of lemonade sold, and force the competition out of business..."</pre>

<pre>Any response to that was interrupted by a distinct pattern of knocking. Harry moved to the door and gave the counter knock. A moment later the door swung open to reveal Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Luna Lovegood.

"Alright. Hermione, what was the very first spell Ron and I saw you perform? Ron, how did we survive the Acromantula colony? Luna, if you are traveling south on a Firebolt going half speed and throw a Puffskein at a Nargle, and wind resistance is a thing that exists, how many cupcakes can I buy from Cthulhu for a human soul?"

"Occulus Reparo." "Dad's Ford Anglia." "Pi to the power of the age of the human soul divided by seven."

"Alright then. Go ahead and ask." Harry said waiting for what they would come up with.

"Harry, what animal did I want to follow instead of the Spiders?" Ron decided a related question would be best.

"The Butterflies, and for the record I agree with you." Harry chuckled heartily.

"Nymphadora…" Hermione began to ask and seeing the woman's hair began to change and her wand came out. Hermione just smiled. "Nobody can fake that reaction."

"Fleur, do you have my money?" Luna just held out her hand.

"Oui, twenty three galleons, 11 sickles, and 8 knuts." Fleur murmured as she drew out a money purse and tossed it to the young woman. "And I still cannot believe you were right. The Detroit Manticores crushed the Paris Salamanders one 'undred eight to seven."</pre>

<pre>Ginny Weasley had a plan, a most beautiful, wonderful and inspired plan. She was going to marry Harry Potter and there wasn't a thing anyone could do to stop it. Ginny knew that Harry had no idea about the intricate rituals and bindings involved in a Traditional Magical Wedding. She was going to use his ignorance against him. When he accepted being Remus' best man he was binding himself to marry in Remus' place if somehow the werewolf did not make it to the wedding in time. As Maid of Honor, Ginny was would be bound to marry in Tonks' place should the metamorphmagus not be able to. Ginny was going to make damned sure than neither Remus nor Tonks was anywhere remotely near the site of the ceremony. Then Harry Potter would be hers, all hers.

+

"I believe Ronald drew the short straw there." Molly said with a shake of her head.

"Oh dear, this will not end well, will it?"

"Alright Harry, you Lucky Bastard, I have Good News, Great News, and Amazing News." Ronald Weasley for once was not actually jealous of Harry Potter. Nope, he was too firmly in love with Hermione Granger to actually be jealous. If it had been Hermione that Harry was being forced to marry, Ron was sure he would be close to committing mass murder, but it wasn't so for once in his life he was not jealous of the golden egg that just fell out of Harry's arse. The cheering charm the Twins cast on him might have helped a bit. "First the good news: we found Bill and Remus."

"Oh thank Merlin. I was really beginning to get worried." Harry sighed in relief. He had been half afraid that somehow Death Eaters had killed Remus and Bill. Remus was what he believed an Uncle should be and Bill was definitely the cool older brother. "Okay, what is the Great News."

"Well, the Great News is despite having fallen into a Sultan's Harem Chambers they get to keep their bollocks." Ron said with chuckle. "The Amazing news is to do that they had to marry the Sultan's daughters so you have to marry Fleur and Tonks."

"WHAT?"

"I know right! Two of the three hottest women in the world and you are marrying them." Ron clapped an almost catatonic Harry on the back. "I mean it's what the Best Man does in Traditional Wizarding Weddings, they Marry the Bride if the Groom is for some reason unable to. Since a married man can't go through the rituals obviously Bill and Remus can't marry Fleur and Tonks."

"WHAT?"

"It all has to do with how the Wedding Ritual works. If the Ritual isn't completed the magical cores of the participants explode. According to legend the last time that happened was Pompeii." Ronald continued unaware that Harry was not taking this half as well as he was. "They tried to change the ritual, but that led to Slave Bonds and House Elves."

"House Elves?"

"Yes, those who did the altered rituals evolved over a few hundred years into House Elves. So the new rituals were dropped completely and Wizards went back to the old ones." Ron explained as if it was common knowledge. And truthfully it was to PureBloods around the world. "But enough about that. We need to get you out there and get the ceremony going. Just be thankful they don't do public consummations anymore. Merlin knows if they did pictures of yours would be all over the Daily Prophet. Then people would wonder if you're part Minotaur."

+

"It is true, we could have done much, much worse. The only alternate on William's list that even half way measured to you was his partner Simon, but he is…how you say…queer? He prefers other men, well actually he prefers male dwarves but that is another story." Fleur shook her head slightly as she rambled a bit.</pre>

<pre>"Don't mention it, Mr. Potter. Now the reason I'm here is to, first, tell you both congratulations on your soul bonding" the woman saw both of them looking at her a little strangely "A soul bond is, simply put, when two souls are so intertwined that they follow one another even after death. John was quite impressed by that little stunt Mr. Potter"

"Wait, I did it?" asked Harry in clear confusion

"*Nod* though not on purpose of that I'm sure. Your love for young Miss Weaver was simply strong enough for you to pull her soul out of hell and back to earth with you" replied the woman with a smile

"Hold a moment! I went to hell?!" yelled Vanessa

"… surely you are joking Miss Weaver? You and Mr. Potter here are both on Hell's hiring list. They want you as part of their torture department… though they are a bit cross with Mr. Potter for pulling you out of there before they could even off you the job" replied the woman

"We are on hell's hiring list?" asked Vanessa wide eyed

"And on Heaven's black list for that matter" added the woman

"So we are never getting into heaven?" asked Harry

"You killed God's great-granddaughter less than 24 hours before dying, so no Mr. Potter, you will not be getting into heaven" drawled the woman in reply

"The crown princess of Britain was God's great-granddaughter? Oops…" muttered Harry

"I told you it was a bad job, Ace!" yelled Vanessa

"Wait a moment… was that why the suit looked so close to pissing himself? He knew who we had just offed?" asked Harry

+

"*Sigh* I'm a citizen of the Ashwoods, have been since my sixth year. You didn't think that my Queen would let some random British wizard touch her just like that, or build him a staff for that matter?" replied Ace in his own questioning tone

"Mr. Potter, are you really a citizen of the Ashwoods?" interrupted Rose

"Yes, why?" asked Ace in turn

"Because that would explain why John had to fight for your soul with the Dark Elf Goddess… you know we only managed to reacquire your soul after promising to bring you back to life. Their Goddess was even quite ready to march straight into Hell and inform the current Devil about your *ahem* change in employment" replied Rose with a bit of awe in her voice</pre>

<pre>Xeno nodded. 'Pheonix tears will suit you well. Come on, you have to pack.' He took the vial back off the shelf and slid it into Harry's hand before stepping out of the room. Luna grabbed Harry's free hand again and dragged him back out too.

'But I didn't-'

'You'll upset us if you don't take it.' She whispered, before giggling, then saying in a louder voice, 'Come on, your trunk is in shambles and Tom is expecting you.'

Completely thrown for a loop, and his brain not functioning, Harry startled. 'Voldemort's what?'

Luna gave him a very odd look (which always made Harry squirm coming from her),

'Does the Dark Lord run the Leaky Cauldron now? That would explain a lot about the floo taxes from Diagon Alley.'

'It would indeed dear, how curious.' Xeno nodded.

'Ah-' Harry cursed himself internally, but thankfully Xeno seemed to go off on a tangent.

'Did you know that regular floo powder is made from crushed up Deetlebungs. They are actually endangered and I have been partitioning the International Board of Magical Transportation for some time now.'

'Ah-'

'They should switch to flee powder.'

'Is that what you use?'

'Yes. It's made from unicorn dust. Nasty little things.'

'Unicorns?' Harry asked completely confused.

'Of course! They are pure evil. Only interested in virgins, indeed.'

'Ah.'</pre>

<pre>Rather than try to pull up, Harry instead pushed downwards, aiming for the open door and the people who were diving for cover as he approached.

.

"…and so," Jeremy Clarkson narrated to the camera, "We decided to start the race from here, the headquarters of the… bloody hell!"

"Sooooorrrryyyyyyyyy!" The teen that had flown past shouted, his apology dopplering as he managed to make the turn at the end of the corridor. Jeremy started to pull himself back onto his feet, only to dive for the floor again as a trio of cloaked men flew past him in pursuit of the corridor.

"Were they on… broomsticks?" He asked in shock.

"They're headed for the main news room!" The cameraman gasped. "They're live!"

Both men exchanged glances, then they scrambled to their feet and sprinted towards the distant screams.</pre>

<pre>Harry always knew that he was different. He could see things in greater detail or over greater distances than enyone else he knew of. He could heal faster than his obese cousin and could run faster than almost anyone in the neighbourhood.

Then there were the really odd things that happened, like when Petunia took offense to him asking about his parents and tried to hit him with a frying pan.

The pan had soon ended up in the bin since the impression of Harry's face in it made it almost impossible to use for cooking.

Then there was the time that Vernon had tried to slam the front door in his face. A simple punch had turned the door into kindling.

That evening, Harry had been moved from the cupboard under the stairs to the smallest bedroom with the understanding that as long as he remained out of sight, the Dursleys would ignore him. Soon after, Harry got a job as a paperboy, delivering papers for the local newsagent. It was then that he discovered that not only could he run very fast, he could also leap a full five meters into the air. That discovery had been due to a dog lunging at him. The next day, the dog had caught him by surprise and broken six of its teeth trying to bite him. Harry hadn't mentioned it to anyone, but the owner had been forced to spend a great deal of money on vets bills and the dog had since refused to go anywhere near Harry.

Looking round to check that no-one was watching, he hooked his fingers under the side of Vernon's car and then straightened, before lowering it back down.

He had no idea how he was getting powers like that, but he wasn't going to complain.

+

Harry pushed against the door, splintering the lock and stepped into the room.

"Hello, Fluffy." He smiled as the Cerberus greeted him. "Hey, I need to go stop that thief who snuck past you when you were asleep."

Fluffy blinked, then started sniffing before growling at the trapdoor. Moving back, the three-headed dog allowed Harry to drop through the hole and onto the plant.

"Devil's Snare." Harry whispered, glad that he had described the plant to Neville and got a description. "Lumos!"

His wand shone and Harry dropped through, glad that he had sent Hermione off to explain things to Professor McGonagall.

The next room was filled with winged keys, but Harry ignored them and the broomsticks by the entrance as he strode across the room. Forming a fist, he punched the door.

"Bloody hell!"

Shaking his hand to try and get the feeling back, Harry glared at the unmarred door, then it shuddered and fell. Harry stared at it, then his gaze rose to the cracked archway it had been blocking.

"Wizards." He snorted. "Reinforce the door and ignore the doorframe."</pre>

<pre>"Would you look at that intense face, Gred!"

"I see it, Forge. It looks like Harry is going to glare the Age Line into submission."

And of course, there were the Weasley twins, who might actually be stronger than Diggory, but were still half a year from being old enough to enter.

"I'm just waiting for the right moment to enter my name." Harry replied complacently.

"Well, while you're doing that, we'll just go ahead and enter if you don't mind."

"You may proceed." He said magnanimously, waving them forward.

"Thank you, Your Grace." The twins chorused and gave a dramatic bow.

"Aging potion?" Harry guessed, seeing them unstopper two vials .

"Indeed, just enough to make us seventeen."

"It won't work." Harry informed them, knowing that an Age Line didn't work based on the physical age of the body.

"We'll see about that, Harrykins."

They did indeed see, as they were thrown away from the Goblet, sporting long white beards and being the targets of much laughter.

"I told you so." Harry said with well earned smugness.

"Very well then, we know when we're beaten."They declared with dignity." Reveal to us the secret of getting past the Age Line, oh great Potter.

"The secret..." Harry paused dramatically, knowing that there were quite a few people listening to his words. "is that you don't need to get past the Age Line."

"Errr, so you're not planning to enter then?" That had come from one of the random Ravenclaws in the crowd. Somehow, despite not announcing it, the entire school had become convinced that he was intending to enter. It was probably one of the few times in history that the Hogwarts rumor mill actually got something 100% correct.

"I am, I'm just not going to bother with the Age line." Harry countered, taking a fist full of parchment scraps with his name on them from his pocket. "Observe."

With that, he threw them all towards the Goblet of Fire. Most of them missed, but several landed inside the ancient artefact and caused it to flare with blue fire as his entry was accepted. He felt a corresponding 'ping' in his own magic from the Goblet as it happened. That was good, because he hadn't actually been 100% sure that throwing parchment into the Goblet from a distance would work. The artefact couldn't read after all, but names were powerful seals. By signing his name on a piece of parchment, he had imbued it with a piece of his identity. The other option had been that the Goblet reacted to the magic of the person submitting the parchment, which would have required him to dismantle the Age Line. Fortunately it had been the former, otherwise he would have looked quite foolish.

"You see, an Age Line is an exclusion style area denial spell that reacts in contact with a witch or wizards' mind. If you know yourself to be older than the specified age, then it will let you pass, otherwise it will expel you. A flying piece of parchment has no mind so the Age line doesn't react." He explained to the stunned looking crowd.

"Such simplicity..." George said.

"Such elegance..." Fred added.

"We are in awe." The twins finished together. "Now if you will excuse us, we're off to do this ourselves before Dumbledore decides to ward against it."

They weren't the only ones that scrambled for the nearest piece of parchment to repeat Harry's method.

Dumbledore had in fact been on his way to check on the Goblet and had seen his security circumvented, but it was too late to do anything about it. He knew that Harry would be chosen as the Hogwarts champion now, he was far too strong for it to be otherwise. There was no more point in preventing entry.</pre>

<pre>"We do something nice for them, yes?" Alkrat interrupted happily. "The people with the shops."

"Why would we do something like that?" Barchoke asked in return.

"For them to like us," the odd goblin answered with a grin. "We be the happy bank you business like."

Looking over to Bankor he asked, "Did any of that make sense to you?"

"Perhaps," the other goblin said with a curiously thoughtful look on his face. "Our dealings with humans have historically been centered on the Ministry of Magic itself," he began to lecture. "Rarely, if ever, have we concerned ourselves with our image with the general public – the latest weekend issue of the Prophet notwithstanding that is – so establishing some sort of rapport with the shops themselves may lead them to think of us positively."

"Oh, yes-yes-yes," the happy little Alkrat said as if it'd all been agreed. "I get them dates. You buy dates here, yes? Or maybe fruits? I get them fruits. They like fruits."

"And how about we say, 'They're not dead yet'? That'd work, wouldn't it?" Slaggran added as if he were actually helping before looking at them uncertainly. "Wait, they're not dead, are they?"

"Of course the captives aren't dead," Fillast replied for him with a look that was more than a little perturbed at the question. "Overseer Braglast and I are keeping them well supplied, now that we know what they eat."

Coming so soon after Alkrat's fruity concern, something in that caught Barchoke's attention.

"You didn't try feeding them cats, did you?" he asked.

"You said to treat them as well as we would the guards," the building's director reminded him, "so we started them out on dogs, thinking that we could improve the meals to cats if they remained compliant, or snakes if they failed to do so."

"Oh no," he said with a shake of his head, remembering the frizzy-haired girl's umbrage just at the thought of them doing the same themselves.

"This is problem?" Alkrat asked. "Many places eat dog. Very tasty."

"Not here they don't," Slaggran wheezed in to inform them.

"We know that now," Fillast replied defensively. "Since then we've been providing them through the tunnels with a muggle supply of pig."</pre>

<pre>"Can you cure my lycanthropy like you did two of the ones I attacked?"

Harry narrowed his eyes.

"How did you know I cured them?"

"Did you want to keep it a secret? If so, you shouldn't have shown your face in St. Mungo's and got all the healers talking."

"Kelly Valopolis." Ms. Gilligan hissed. Harry only sighed.

"It was the quickest way to get things done. I'm sorry, Kelly. I did not cure their lycanthropy."

When she began to speak, he shook his head and held up one hand.

"No, I didn't. I amputated the infected limb, then simply had a new limb made and reattached. Lycanthropy, that I've seen so far, is a mutation that affects the very base humanity of your body. Maybe, if I was in very close contact with you before your infection, I could recreate your body pre-infection and… but that doesn't matter here. The body you have is a werewolf, and to change it could have disastrous consequences. Your body would probably no longer function properly. Maybe, with a great deal of experimentation, a technique could be developed. But that experimentation would result no doubt in many people dying during the attempts. The risk outweighs the possible rewards."

"That's why you didn't cure Mr. Periwinkle then." Kelly said, her voice deflated.

Harry nodded, though in his mind he had already considered just such experimentation. With death being a reversible state under his magic, he could risk killing a willing subject and simply resurrect them at will.

But he wasn't yet willing to take on human experimentation of that scale even if he did have the time to devote to it. If Hermione objected to him killing and resurrecting birds, he didn't doubt her reaction to him doing the same on human bodies would be… extreme.</pre>

<pre>"Hey you two! Fred, George, wait up!" Harry called to the Weasley twins as he saw them passing in the corridor Monday afternoon.

"Harry? You want something?" the twins asked nervously. They had been very careful to avoid Harry unless he sought them out first. After the Coven had found out it was them who had inadvertently convinced him to sign the Betrothal Contract, they'd found Hogwarts a lot scarier a place.

Laughing, Harry leaned forward and hugged both of them. "You guys are the best! Seriously, I really mean that. From now on, you need something – anything – you come talk to me! I got your backs!"

The twins stared at each other and then at Harry completely lost. "Ugh, sure," George said scratching his head.

Fred peered at the fourth year. "And what pray tell has brought this on, Harry?"

Harry just grinned and leaned in to whisper, "Let's just say I know why people around here love broom closets so much now." Their eyes widened. "Three women for the price of one? Best. Contract. Ever." He pulled back laughing and walked away whistling.

The twins shook their heads and looked at each other. "Only Harry Potter…"</pre>

<pre>As the cold lost its grip sound intruded from the opened window, and with it the kid's focus shifted again.

"-ON'T CARE WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING, GET THE FUCK OUT!"

Harry's enraged voice made itself known, and as one they friends moved to the window. Outside an eight foot tall Harry menaced what could only be an honest-to-Merlin dementor, and it looked like his intimidation was working! At least on that one.

Half a dozen more of the denizens of hell were crowding around the pair, leaving a middle school style clearing for a fight, and two or three times that number were floating in towards the group.

"YOU AND I BOTH KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS I, YOU SOUL SUCKING FUCK! OH, A COUPLE OF HAPPY KIDS, NOTHING LIKE A BIT IF A SNACK!" Harry stepped back and took a look at the assembling crowd, his voice falling as his anger cooled, "DON'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME WE MET!"

The dementor he had been yelling at had evidently had enough, and came at Harry mouth first. The kids could feel the effect of the dementors intensify from where they were, fifteen or so meters distant from the action. For his part, in the middle of the action, Harry didn't quail. If anything his rage visibly increased, and he backhanded the demon as it neared, sending it to the floor and causing the crowd around him to begin milling about, whether in anger of fear was difficult to tell.

In a flash of fire too bright to look at Hedwig appeared and puffed up regally on Harry's shoulder. She sang a few bars of what was unmistakably 'Puttin' on the Ritz' and the fiends shrank back almost as one.

"I will only say this once, you ethereal good for nothing bloody hooligans, I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE, FUCK OFF OR WE'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT TAKES TO KILL ONE OF YOU!"

With that Harry brandished his wand and with a shout summoned his patronus, Nym shivered anew at the sight of Mr. Murder Beaver, and the small glowing mammal earned its keep immediately by dispersing the crowd. The dementors took a decidedly away-from-the-train direction as they floated off.</pre>

<pre>"Hi, Luna. Good day so far?" Harry asked, his grin not dropping for an instant.

"Yes, Harry. It has been quite pleasant. What is in your arms?" Luna asked. People started quieting down in the Common Room as they saw something interesting happening. Luna resisted the urge to sigh. The Gryffindors may not be bullying wrackspurts like the Ravenclaws but they enjoyed their gossip far too much at times. She had honestly been rather surprised to learn that despite Lavender and Parvati's reputations as gossip queens the two were some of the politest about their chosen hobby. It seemed to be largely the upper years and Romilda Vane who were the worst of the lot.

Harry lightly stroked the blanket which quivered again in response. "Oh, this?" His grin widened even further. Luna saw Hermione cock her head off to the side and Ginny plopped down near the twins looking around in confusion.

Luna nodded. "Yes, Harry. Your package appears to be alive."

"It is," he stepping up to her. He held out his arms. "Here, she's a gift for you." Luna's dreamy expression faltered and she felt a frown of confusion slip through. A gift? Why would Harry be giving her an animal as a gift? She slowly reached out and pulled the blanket aside.

Luna's eyes widened and she let out a scream of pure, unadulterated glee. Her hands shot forward to grab the small creature and started whirling around before abruptly stopping and bringing it into her chest to cuddle. The small animal made an amused sounding snort and a tiny tongue reached out and licked her cheek. Luna let out another whoop of delight and turned back to Harry. "Harry! You found a crumple-horned snorkack! You gave me a crumple-horned snorkack! A crumple-horned snorkack!" She jumped forward and kissed both his cheeks before pulling back and holding out the tiny snorkack. It wiggled its adorable little nose at her and seemed to grin in amusement. "Oh Merlin, it's grinning at me! It's grinning! Harry, you are amazing! You are the best! There are – I don't even know enough words to describe this! I have to write a letter to Daddy immediately! It's a snorkack!" Luna – and the snorkack clinging to her chest – tore off towards the stairs to her dorm desperate to find parchment and quill.

As Luna left, barely coherent, the rest of the room stared between where she had disappeared to and Harry chuckling softly as he took her vacated seat on the couch. "Well, that went a bit better than I expected actually. I had been wondering if she'd be able to talk after I gave her the critter."

"Harry," Hermione said slowly and carefully. "Was that animal…really a crumple-horned snorkack?"

"Yup."

"Honestly?"

"Cross my heart and hope to die."

"A crumple-horned snorkack."

"Yes, Hermione." Harry was grinning like a loon at this point and his girlfriend just looked increasingly astounded.

"An actual imaginary creature?" she asked.

"Not so imaginary, it turns out," Harry said nodding along.

Hermione made a noise that Harry couldn't quite identify and drew herself closer to him. "Only you could go to Gringotts trying to get emancipated and walk away with a bloody imaginary creature," she muttered into his chest sounding despondent.</pre>

<pre>So what you're saying is that the teachers are basically brainwashing us through a useless competition with no real prize into not getting into too much trouble," Katie summarized.

"That is absolutely what I'm saying," Harry agreed. "And they're quite good at it, too. Why else would not only my own House but two others be so pissed at me for putting us behind? And honestly, if Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff want Slytherin to lose so badly, they should try getting some points themselves. I mean, Hermione used to get points for her brilliance every time she walked into a classroom where the teacher was alive and not Snape so why haven't the Ravenclaws taken advantage of this?"

"That's actually a good question," Dean remarked.

"Yeah, and now they're acting like it's inevitable that Slytherin's going to win again," Parvati noted. "No wonder they never do."

"This isn't the case at all, Harry," Percy objected. "The House Cup system isn't trying to bribe you; it's merely an encouragement to do well and a discouragement to do things you aren't supposed to."

The twins exchanged glances. "Okay, now I'm positive that this whole 'House Cup' thing is evil," one said.

"With Percy's approval, it must be," the other concurred.

Percy glared at them but said nothing.

"Hey, this means we're free to do whatever we feel like doing without having to worry about anything besides detention since our peers won't hate us for trying to blow up the Slytherin Common Rooms again," Lee realized.

"So you see, it really is more of a 'suck-up' cup than a House one. And do any of us REALLY want to be suck-ups?" Harry asked rhetorically.

Now looking rather mutinous and not a little gleeful, the House of Gryffindor assured them they did not.

In the end, Dumbledore was forced to give them 837 points to give them a victory over Slytherin.</pre>

<pre>The rest of the day and most of the following one went about as one might expect. Susan got lost on the floor of the expo, Kingsley got caught by casino security for using legilimency on fellow players in a game of poker, Rufus drank a bottle of Everclear thinking that the bartender was offering him an expensive bottle of water, and shortly after remembering why she never - ever - gave her people serious amounts of time off, Amelia received a call.

Susan was easily collected, though it was difficult to overlook the collection of handbills she promptly hid, each bearing a picture more enticing than the last alongside dubious assurances of safety and different contact addresses.

Kingsley had to be struck behind the ears, forced into returning every red cent he had gained, and even then she had barely secured him by lying about his coverage under her diplomatic credentials.

Rufus was just drunk, which was fairly easy to compensate for.

Dragging her adopted daughter by the hand, her idiot employee by his idiot ear, and forcing Susan to keep a hold on the alcoholic, Amelia cleared out of the Excalibur hotel and resort and rushed her party to the temporary portkey terminal hidden in the worksite around the fake pyramid they were building.

She had to abuse her credentials a second time to get them past the lines, and a third time to 'see' the officer in charge. As soon as she was on the secure side of passport control, but before she could be brought before one Commissioner Jan Lyle Laverty Jones (a bit pompus if you asked her), Amelia relinquished Shacklebolt to Susan's care and bargained at the point of a wand for a portkey heading anywhere across the pond.

A nice Welsh couple were very unhappy to have their comically oversized margarita glass summoned from their grasp, and they were even less pleased when Amelia changed the endpoint of the enchanted transport to land a little closer to home.

+

"In light of the fact that the office of the Minister cannot proceed in the hunt for Sirius Black, I move that the authority to pursue the escaped criminal Sirius Black be returned to the Department of Magical Law enforcement, as the only body left even remotely qualified to act."

Then a voice came from on high to save Cornelius, or at least from a place two levels up from the floor, and it wasn't really a voice as much as a giant enchanted crystal flashing from clear to black. The Chief Warlock replacement spoke up in response.

"Your motion to have the authority to pursue the hunt for Sirius Black be reassigned has been denied, the reasons listed are..."

He trailed off, allowing a moment for the parchment lying on the large crystal embedded in his desk to finish filling with tiny lines of text written in a very precise hand. Picking up the list he rearranged his glasses and read carefully, "No Wizengamot decision reached with more than seventeen of every twenty-nine assembled members voting in the affirmative may be reversed in the same lunar phase as it was enacted, no Wizengamot decision reached with a proportion of voting members present less than nineteen of forty-one may be appealed without the exact same members in chamber but a voting proportion present greater than thirty-one of forty-one, no Wizengamot decision may be reversed without the normal chief warlock present alongside a full recitation of the minutes from the previous meeting and the meeting wherein the decision was made, no Wizengamot decision may be..."

Amelia took her seat again and slumped in her chair, defeat written across her face. Fudge did his best to stop from adopting a similar position. Of course. It seems they both forgot the cardinal rule of dealing with the Wizengamot.

Don't.

It was why the annual budget meetings were done in the canteen, and passed by a simple vote of the department heads, and why he and Amelia usually worked these things out in closed door meetings in one of their offices.

Merlin.

Muffled from behind her hand, her voice reduced to a shade above a murmur, Amelia spoke again, "Okay. So If the DMLE can't do it, we can't arrange anything through the Minister's office or my own by extension, which leaves us what? Accidents and Catastrophes doesn't have the personnel or training, they struggle to clean up after idiots apparating in front of muggles as is. Transportation is out, International Cooperation is out, and Mysteries won't return our calls," removing her hands from her face, she ticked off each of the ministry's department's in turn, "Games and Sports are the only department left able to contract hit wizards, but after the world Cup back in sixteen ninety-three their charter specifically forbids any contracts with bounty hunters of any kind including clauses that would direct them to hunt any one person or group of people over any other, so unless we want to turn all law enforcement over the hit wizards for the next twenty years, because the bloody hit wizards guild made that their minimum contract length, we're left with...?"

She looked up and met Cornelius' eyes for the first time since the ten minute recitation from the temporary Chief Warlock, "The DRCMC?"

And like lightning, Cornelius had an amazing idea!

"The Dementors!"

From the back Tiberius Ogden, holder of the family seat for clan Ogden, woke with a snort and cried out, "Dementors! Where!"

He drew his wand and with a weak cry of, "Expecto Patronum!" cast a wispy white shield over his head. Naturally his shield scared Druella Scheart on the level above, holder of the Scheart family seat in waiting for her nephew Redd, who's flailing arms clipped a granite paperweight at the edge of her desk. The weight promptly fell off the side of her desk and onto Tiberius' head, knocking him out cold.

While all of the men and women in the vicinity scrambled to provide aide to the terrified and injured pensioners, Delores appeared again at his side and Fudge turned to her, grateful for the distraction he had inadvertently caused.

"Where have you been!? Everything's turned around on us, did you know they have reports that I was responsible for this? Carrying some jovial little beast around with me, eyeing up Wizengamot member offices!"

The short and unfortunately dressed woman looked up at him, blinking in confusion.

Offering the papers she held she spoke uncertainly, "I have historical precedent of using hit wizards by Wizengamot order successfully?"</pre>

<pre>A few of the professors had dropped in. They were mostly stuttering wrecks, not knowing what to say or having the ability to say it. Though the Flamels had been calm and helpful. That aura they carried hadn't lasted long around Harry after they departed, though.

Nothing helped.

Even Harry's wand was gone. As soon as he was healed of his tuberculosis and that cursed wound, he'd need to go to Ollivanders for a new one.

Not even the phoenix feather survived. Nor would he get a new one. No one had seen Fawkes since Dumbledore died.

There were the things Sirius wasn't saying, too. Still people talked, the professors mostly and a few investigators, and Harry heard. Those Dementors had Kissed three and given nightmares to hundreds more.

There was a little justice in who the victims were. Bellatrix Lestrange was soulless. An Auror guarding the Minister of Magic was gone – as was his protectee, Cornelius Fudge, the one who had ordered the Dementors emplaced at Hogwarts. Slain by his own decision, that was a neat thing...

From the fragments Harry caught, the soulless Fudge was still Minister of Magic until his body died or the Wizengamot removed him. No one was placing bets on which would happen first. Politics and coalitions and jockeying...

At least Fudge couldn't do any more damage. Some caretaker in the Ministry had even ordered the Dementors removed. After all, all three of their targets were dealt with. And they had only managed to desoul the Minister of Magic.</pre>

"Didn't Harry already go over this?" Hermione asked with a sigh. "But just to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, let me see that parchment with his name on it." Dumbledore passed it to her and she studied it briefly before exclaiming triumphantly, "There is no way Harry wrote this!"

"How can you tell?" Professor Moody asked, limping into the room and looking a bit disconcerted.

"It's legible," came the simple response.

"Hey!"

"Makes sense to me," Snape put in.</pre>

<pre>Harry was sat between the Carrow twins with Astoria, Tracey, and Millicent opposite him, enjoying lunch at the Slytherin table.

“I think,” Harry said slowly, “that we’re going to need to find out who is orchestrating this campaign against Dumbledore.”

“Why?” Hestia asked.

“Because it’s really clever and we’re going to want them on our side.”

The five girls all leaned in closer. “Explain, Harry,” Millicent requested.

“They’re dragging Dumbledore from pillar to post. He’s been called to the ICW, to the Wizengamot and to the school. As soon as he’s finished with one, they are calling him to another. They are also using the wrong title each time. Dumbledore is getting very little rest, and is always a little late to everything. It’s giving him a bad reputation, and he’s not as young as he once was.

“They are forcing him to choose one position. And they are doing it without a bad word in the press. It’s a really impressive strategy.”

The doors opened and Sirius entered, accompanied by both senior Malfoys.

“Lord Black, Lord and Lady Malfoy?” Dumbledore called tiredly.

“Not now, Albus,” Sirius said dismissively. “You concentrate on the inspectors and being where you are supposed to be, old boy.” He walked over and looked at Harry. “Every time I see you, you’re surrounded by pretty girls. It would make your old man so proud.”

“Thanks,” Harry said dryly. “I presume that the distinguished company that you keep means that you’ve visited for some reason other than to try and persuade me once again to build a harem?”

“Sirius,” Narcissa sighed.

“I wasn’t persuading him of that,” Sirius said, sounding hurt. “I was just pointing out that theoretically he could be deemed two people, Black and Potter, and therefore, get a wife for each.”

Harry snorted. “Marriage is a joining between man and woman, not woman and title.”

“Well said,” Narcissa said. “Taking legal advice from Sirius would lead to you being arrested as a bigamist.”

+

“Not being happy with just murder and torture,” Sirius said, “ol’ Whatsisface has also split his soul.”

“That sounds nasty,” Harry said into the silence.

“Sirius!” Dumbledore yelped.

“Do be quiet, Mr Dumbledore,” Narcissa said firmly. “Is there not a meeting of the ICW that you should be attending?”

Dumbledore managed to look even more exhausted. “I’ve decided to end my association with them.”

Narcissa nodded. “There’s going to be a Wizengamot meeting this afternoon. Do make sure you’re on time for a change.”

“Anyway,” Sirius said, seizing back control. “Ignoring the Chief Warlock, as he’s had a lot of meetings to attend over the past few days. Whatsisface has only got two left, and until they’re gone, his great snakiness is going to haunt some poor rats.”

“Mother, Father, why are you helping Potter against our Lord?” Draco yelped.

Harry was actually able to see the shame that appeared in Lucius’ eyes, and the dismayed realisation that appeared in Narcissa’s. He didn’t know them well enough to know whether they disapproved of his words or the public nature of them.

Narcissa turned to the Headmaster. “I’m afraid that my son appears to have come down with an illness. To ensure he doesn’t infect others, we will be taking him home today.” She looked at her son. “Pack, now, and then sit on your trunk.” Her voice was ice hard and implacable.

Draco ran out of the Great Hall.

Narcissa’s face cleared and she gave Harry a small smile. “Sirius was under the impression that if anyone would be able to find something here fast, it would be you.”

“Yeah,” Sirius agreed. He cast a spell and his wand rotated up and to the right. “We’re probably looking for two artefacts, the first is this way and that’s the furthest one away.”

“I don’t know if I should be proud or ashamed that I recognise which way the wand is pointing, and have correlated it with an obvious room as to hide that sort of thing,” he said. “Tracey, you get it?”

“Room of Requirements?”

“Exactly.” Harry looked at his Godfather. “Apart from an ancient artefact, anything else?”

“Possibly a Founder’s heirloom, and feels icky.”

“Dobby, my broom please.” The elf popped in seconds later. “I’ll be back in a second,” he promised. He shot off, allowing the broom to pull him out of the chair before he swung his legs over it and flew out of the hall.

He shot up the stairways and corkscrewed at the top, before using his momentum to shoot through a ninety degree turn, and then went vertical.

He’d wanted an excuse to fly through Hogwarts like this since he’d flown for the first time on a broom. All too soon he arrived at the door to the Room of Requirements. “I need a place that stores a Horcrux,” he muttered as he paced back and forth.</pre>

<pre>Harry was not only invited to the Cullen's baseball game, she was invited to play with them.

"Anyone who can do that much damage to one of us with her bare hands deserves a chance to play," Emmett said.

And then the other vampires showed up, which would have been great, except they had red eyes, making them human-drinkers, rather than animal-drinkers.

"Oh look, you brought a snack," one of them said, looking straight at Harry. Harry opened her mouth to protest, but before she could, Edward put his arm around her shoulders and growled at them. Harry shut her mouth, glared at Edward, and then proceeded to beat him with the baseball bat.

"What the fuck did I tell you about touching me, you shitty little perverted fucker?" Harry yelled. The three human-drinkers watched in horrified awe as Harry hit Edward so hard so many times that the bat began to bend into the shape of Edward's head.

"Holy shit," the female vampire said.

"I'm suddenly not hungry anymore," the one who had called her a snack said.

"I don't think I'll ever be hungry again," the last one said.

Laurent would convert to animal-drinking with help from the Denali clan, while Victoria and James left for the East Coast as soon as they could manage it.</pre>

Shiva rubbed the bridge of her nose again and sat down looking exhausted. "Both tried to perform legilimency on Harry. It's basically mind reading. Very few people can do it well but they're one of the group. It's not supposed to be done except with very good reason or consent. Their reasons weren't very good and neither asked Harry hence why we were angry. Dumbledore probably wanted to know what Harry was thinking about the diary while Snape likely just wanted to see how Harry had ejected Dumbledore."

"And both were fools!" McGonagall spat. Harry's eyebrows rose at that. His Head of House was continuing to impress him this year. "Honestly, you all just finished a tale where Harry's glasses were used to effectively reflect a basilisk stare! What idiot would think a simple legilimency spell would break through that sort of protection?!"

The students looked at each other. Every one of them started to laugh hysterically while McGonagall, Flitwick, Shiva and Pomfrey just shook their heads in exasperation.</pre>

<pre>Time again resumed it normal course of flowing. Well as normal as it could when in magical surrounding. And like it was with time, people spent it to fulfil their plans, be it just studying, getting date for next Hogsmade weekend, even to those illegal... But for now, we should focus on revenge.
Draco Malfoy, even after all his punishment, couldn't control his ambitions, and right after getting back to general population, he begun to look for opportunity to get Longbottom in trouble. At least, that was his plan, until he noticed Potter's suspicious behaviour with his trips between library, owlery and that savages house for some kind of meeting behind closed doors and windows, always carrying some papers. It was just too evident that something was going on, and what would be better than putting Golden Boy in trouble. He was slowly loosing patience, till one day he caught sight of Longbottom, Potter and some girl hurrying to the hut, and a sign of newly hatched dragon was enough for him to go and report it.

Some twenty minutes later he was getting frustrated, having to repeat the same story about a dragon on school grounds, first to his Head of House then Headmaster, and finally to an auror who was brought due to regulations concerning this kind of situation.

"How many times I have to tell you that they have a baby dragon in there. They have to be expelled for it and..." but he didn't finish his animated speech, because Professor McGonagall entered Headmasters office with Harry Potter in tow.

"Excuse me, is it a bad time Headmaster?" asked transfiguration teacher while looking at the people gathered in the room.

"That depends what is it about, Minerva." replied the oldened wizard.

"Potter, if you will?" she said to her student.

"Yes, Professor. Headmaster Dumbledore, I would like to notify you about new dangerous animal on school ground and file paperwork for it's immediate transfer to a suitable reserve." Harry said in his most formal manner.

"What kind of animal?" he asked while looking over his half-moon spectacles between Malfoy and Harry.

"Baby dragon, sir."

Dumbledore just raised an eyebrow, Snape kept his poker face. Malfoy stood there, not understanding what was happening. Auror on the other hand, took the situation in totally different light than just some stupid kid exaggerating seeing a bat up close with dragon attack. Telling it differently, he started to freak out.

"You mean to tell me that there REALLY is an illegal dragon this close to kids?" he asked like he heard it first time, and mentioned dragon stood right behind him.

"A baby dragon, yes. But he's not illegal."

"WHAT? But laws forbid breeding dragons outside of reserves." said Malfoy who just reached his limit.

"Yes, but in case of illegal breeding grounds, qualified personnel can requisite any eggs or animals and place them in properly manned post. Rubeus Hagrid, as a Gamekeeper, having a choice between a dragon omelet and another dragon from a rare breed... Well, lets just say it wasn't a though choice. Paperwork informing that he was in possession of an egg of Norwegian Rigeback was filled shortly after he acquired it." in the middle of Harry's speech auror begun calling the ministry to verify it. Harry seeing that auror was still busy handed Dumbledore the transfer paperwork.

"Norberta?" asked amused wizard seeing first page of the form.

"Well, we wrote first name that came to our heads, but then it turned out that dragon was a girl..."

"Why wasn't this transfer form filed in earlier?" interrupted him auror who finished checking everything in the ministry, but still had to find some fault in the situation.

"It couldn't be any earlier." answered Harry.

"Why is that?"

"Because even if egg was here for a long time, dragon hatched only some thirty minutes ago."

"Dragon, dragon egg. I don't see any difference." replied auror in "who cares" kind of way.

"Well, dragons fly and breathe fire, while eggs are round and do only the breaking part." was Harry's own reply, delivered with a straight face.

After auror stopped and checked how conversation ended with such a sentence, he asked in different words, while closing his eyes and rubbing his temples to prevent a headache.

"I was trying to ask, why it is so important to wait till after the hatching."

"Well, egg once placed in the fire, must stay there undisturbed until the hatching. But even if there was a way to slow dying of the egg itself without any interference to the developing dragon, those forms needs information like gender, which can be checked only after dragon is out of the egg, or that tricky line when they ask age... of the dragon." Harry said last thing with slight smile on his face.

"But still, that egg was here without the knowledge of authorities." accused auror who still tried to make his intervention be a reasoned one.

"That isn't quite true." said Professor McGonagall who till this point stayed quiet. "Mister Potter came to me, a Deputy Headmistress, with this matter, since as Head of Gryffindor, he could reach me faster than Headmaster. I told him that since everything was well taken care of, he just keep me in touch. Today we are here just to notify Headmaster about people coming to take the dragon."

"Okay. Then tell me one thing. If all the paperwork is on Rubeus Hagrid, then why am I speaking to you?" asked auror looking through forms, trying to find any kind of mistake in it.

"Because someone had to stay near the egg, or now, the dragon, to make sure it was safe and not a threat to anyone at the same time. I was just helping Hagrid by carrying paperwork while he did it. Is there anything more? I wouldn't want to miss my next class, and morning break is nearly out..." Harry finally asked.

Dumbledore looked at the auror, who after flipping pages of the form couple of times more, just nodded his head.

"You may go Harry." said the Headmaster.

After Harry and McGonagal left the office, Snape and Malfoy were trying to follow but auror stopped young snake.

"Young man, do you know that there is a fine for unjustified call of a auror?"...

+

With the dragon situation solved, there ought to be some free time for our hero. But no such luck. Because of the exams, teachers threw more and more work at them. Instead of having more time, Harry was running out of it so fast he sometimes thought he was skipping days entirely.

This ended only when Harry's final exam was over, and he had to laugh at the memory of pantomime that he had to do on practical exams. To everyone around, it looked like a proper piece of magic. But only when you would look from a backstage seat, you would see Puppet-Harry waving a piece of wood, while Director-Magie sat at the console operating all the special effects. As funny of a picture it was, it still was essentially true. Of all the magic words that he spoke during those exams, only one working was "Please" when he asked Magie to help him.

+

Of course, Draco's shouting about signed photos brought Lockhart to the place of commotion so fast that Harry didn't have time to end the confrontation, and after Gilderoy took charge of the photos, he started to give his not-yet-as-famous-as-himself hero pointers how to handle those kind of situations. But Harry, with mind already working on a way to make Malfoy go away, saw an opportunity.

"Professor, you should be talking to my manager about such a thing." he interrupted before Lockhart could build up steam.

"A manager?" Defence teacher asked, clearly surprised.

"Yes, Professor. Didn't you see Draco Malfoy making everyone notice the whole thing? You know us Gryffindors, we feel comfortable while in action. I leave business part for the cunning Slytherin."

"Oh, Harry, Harry, Harry. You shouldn't be putting your carrier in others hands, it may..." Lockhart started in his patronizing tone, but again was interupted.

"No, Professor. I took care of that. We have a pretty tight contract and it goes so far, that if you would ask Draco about anything, he would play confused or absolutely deny everything. That's why you should give him subtle hints in random parts of conversation as he truly didn't know what you were talking about. And preferably on many different occasions so no one overhears everything important. You know those secretive Slytherins"

Lockhart begun to nod his head, taking the whole thing as more and more probable, and after Harry's last comment, he went to search out a true mastermind behind Harry's campaign. Because poster boy wasn't important outside of events where they could be seen together, it was better to influence the person in charge and make sure for those occasions to happen. As a results, Draco Malfoy wouldn't hear the end of Gilderoy Lockhart for months.</pre>

<pre>"Moody's…on call, so to speak. We can start as soon as you're ready," Tonks said, giving Remus a Look.

"Tomorrow then. ARGH!" He crumpled to his knees a blinding pain shot through his scar.

"It seems the Potter boy has found another place to hide. Another place that is so well warded, it is beyond my sight. Tell me, how can there be so many holes for him to hide in? Ah, Bellatrix…it seems your delicious niece is with him."

"Shut up and stop perving on Tonks, you snake-faced nutter!" Harry bellowed.

"Potter! Can you hear me?"

"Yes! It works both ways, idiot!"

"Blast! Bellatrix, put your clothes on!"

"THE ACTUAL FUCK? I can't see what's going on—thank Merlin."

"Harry, block him out," Tonks said gently. "Think of something you know would gross him out, and use it to push him out of your mind."

"Like that time Ron, Seamus and I got drunk off Firewhiskey and danced to Prince songs in banana hammocks?" Harry suggested through gritted teeth. He heard a high pitched scream in his mind and grinned. The pain subsiding, he looked up to see the other three looking quite pale. "It didn't actually happen, but it got the bastard out."

"On that note," Remus said, "I think lunch is ready."

"Wait… Voldemort was perving on me?" Tonks yelped, a few minutes too late.

"Lunch, Tonks…."

Hermione and Ginny appeared precisely four minutes and thirty seconds apart, sat on opposite sides of the long table, all with the excruciating precision of an OCD-addled bookworm. When Remus finished what he liked to call his "hot breakfast" (fag and a cuppa), he asked Tilly to get him a chalkboard and some chalk.

"Oh, that's in Miss Hermione's library," Tilly replied. "Miss Hermione, did you get all the books you's wanting?"

Hermione blushed a moment, and mumbled a quiet "Yes, thank you."

"Books?" Remus asked. "Hermione, we were about to start analyzing where we were plan-wise, but if you've – never mind, of course you've been doing some research on your own. What have you found?"

"Well, I –"

"Oh, Miss Hermione's not needing the books for reading, Mr Remus. She's wanting Miss Ginny to – how did she says? - ravage her like Aphrodite naked on a pile of books instead."

The table went silent as Tilly continued.

"Yes, and she is crying out to Miss Ginny 'Come to me now to end this consuming pain, bringing what my heart desires to be brought: Be yourself my ally in this fight!' but youse didn't hears it with her Muffliato."

"That will be all, Tilly," Hermione grumbled, as the rest of the table (minus Ginny, who was very busy trying to slide underneath the table) looked at her agape.

"I's getting your chalkboard now that I remembers where it is, Mr Remus," Tilly said. Then, nearly under her breath she added "Teach a bitch to leave knitted hats for a house-elf, I dids."

Remus was the first to compose himself enough to speak after Tilly's demonstration of House-Elf Retribution.</pre>

<pre>Jasper woke from his potion induced nap an hour past lunch. Sleepy eyed, and sloppily dressed, but very grateful to have the day off, he shambled down into his kitchen, one hand reaching under his t-shirt to scratch at his belly as he plopped down into his usual chair, and reached with the free hand into the fruit bowl for a banana.

Then he heard a giggle.

Peeling his sleepy eyes to the fullest open, and firing up dazed mental neurons, he found the same little lad as the night before sitting plum on his Ally's lap, eating scrambled eggs and apple slices. He rubbed his eyes. Looked again, and rubbed a third time.

"Oh, for heaven's sake, Jasper. Stop that." Ally growled.

There were times he honestly wondered who was the werewolf in this relationship. This was apparently going to be one of those times.

"Harry, this brute of a man is my husband, Jasper."

Harry, with big green eyes, stared solemnly from under a shaggy mop of dark hair at his face, committing it to memory. He nodded after a long moment of pursed lips and deep consideration. "Doggy!" He declared."You were the doggy last night!"

Jasper's jaw fell somewhere to the floor. Ally stiffened too. "What doggy, sweetie?" She asked shakily.

"The big grey and brown doggy." Harry twisted to look up at her, his hair shifting as he did to showcase a spectacular scar on the boy's forehead. "I thought it was gonna eat me." He told her confidentially. "But it sniffed me, and then pulled me to hide under the big green bush, and then kept me warm." The child explained, looking at Ally gravely. " He was very nice doggy." This he twisted his wee body to gift a sweet smile to Jasper.

"He can be." Ally agreed faintly. She didn't add how Jasper was sweet 99% of the time, just not the 1% that was the full moon. Oh dear.

+

"He's the Boy-Who-Lived!" Her husband prattled on.

""Well, obviously, he lived. I'm tell you, whatever may have happened last night, you did not bite him, or try to bite him." She eyed a dress sock heel rather critically. The heel was completely out of the poor sock. "Honestly, what do you do to your socks, Jasper? Gnaw on them?" She tossed the pair into a bin beside the bed.

Jasper closed his eyes and pinched his nose. "Luv, I know that your Da and Grand-Da did not speak much of the magical world, or your illustrious extended family, and well other than ensuring you learned potions and herbology… you've not got a clue on current events, but, you do know about the Dark Lord, right?"

"Lord Voldie-thingamabob." Ally nodded. "Of course."

"That lad downstairs is the very same lad who defeated Lord Thingamabob at fifteen months old, mere minutes after the Lord Thingamabob killed his parents. As Dark Lords went, this one was a bit overly fond of the killing curse."

Ally blinked. She put down the socks she was examining, and stared at her husband. They'd been married five years now, and normally, while they acknowledged they did have magical relatives, they were pretty removed (with the exception of one night per month) from magic. Jasper was a wizard, yes, but he eschewed that life given the prejudice the wizarding world held against werewolves. "A baby killed the Dark Lord? What? Were his nappies radioactive or something?" She blinked. "Honestly? A baby?" She shook her head in complete askance, her mouth twisted in disgust. "Well, he wasn't much of a Dark Lord then, was he?"

"Oh, he was." Jasper rolled his eyes. "That's why that lad is so celebrated in the magical world as the Boy Who Lived. And now, you're telling me, he lived only to be placed with the worst sort of non magicals alive and has been treated far worse that a Black could treat a house-elf."

Ally pursed her lips. "I don't like the aspersions on my family, Jasper. They are your in-laws, not your outlaws. But, yes."

"Fucking fantastic." Her husband threw up his hands. "If anyone finds out I got out and nearly attacked the Boy-Who-Lived, I'll be kissed for certain."

"I've never threatened to withhold sexual favors just because you escaped." His wife said with exasperation. "You'll definitely be kissed, because you didn't eat the lad."

He threw himself on the bed, making the laundry basket bounce, and buried his face in a pillow, shoulders heaving with laughter.

"This is a magical thing, this kiss, you're talking about, isn't it?" She guessed.

He nodded into the pillow.

"A bad magical thing?"

He nodded again, the head bobbing in the pillow.

"You could stop laughing at me at any time, now." She poked at his backside. He still kept snickering into the pillow.

"Right. Well then. I'm going to abandon you in favor of Mr. Boy-Who-Obviously-Lived. He and I are watching Robin Hood next. Then we're going to the park. We are ordering in for dinner." She informed him haughtily. "Tonight, I'll contact Grand-dad. And I'll find out what he has to say about your attitude towards my magical naivete."

If anything, the ridiculous man started laughing harder. Honestly. It was hard being the wife of a werewolf.</pre>

<pre>"But why did you change them into buzzards, why not kill them?" Percy asked harshly, bringing everyone's attention back to the fact that he was still with them.

Fred and Ginny simply rolled their eyes; Percy would never understand the type of person that Luna Lovegood was, or the person that Harry Potter had become over the last year.

"It would be wrong to kill them," Luna explained with wide-eyed innocence.

"As buzzards they can make a new start and be useful to the world," Harry explained.

"How, by eating carrion?" Fred asked incredulously.

"Well it has to be done, and they weren't very nice people," Luna explained patiently.

At that moment Ginny Weasley broke into laughter at the look on Percy's face; it was priceless. He would never understand Luna.

Madam Bones watched the two teens in amazement, and she realized that the world owed the two an almost insurmountable debt. "Is there anything that I can do for you….I mean to reward you for what you've done," she sputtered out, quite at a loss for the right words.

"No, I think I have everything I want, thank you," the boy said sincerely as he took Luna's hand and drew her closer to his side.

But at that moment Luna squeezed Harry's hand and gave him a significant look. It was clear that the young woman was communicating her disagreement with the young man's statement. A look of realization appeared on his face, and was quickly followed by a smirk.

"Err…Madam Bones, there is one thing that Luna and I would like very much," Harry began hesitantly. "Well, you see, Luna and I would like to be married. The problem is that she doesn't turn seventeen until next February; and we were hoping it might be possible…"

"No, no, that is quite impossible, Mr. Potter," Percy Weasley said snidely as he interrupted Harry's question and the answer that Madam Bones was formulating. "The Minister simply can't make an exception to the laws for you or anyone else. It would not be right."

Madam Bones looked on in shock as Percy Weasley lectured the two people who had just saved their world. She also noticed that the other teens in the room appeared quite ready to hex Percy at that very moment, and that Fred and Ginny had already drawn their wands.

"Mr. Weasley; I understand that you have high political ambitions, and perhaps even the office of Minister in a few years," Madam Bones said as she carefully changed the subject.

"Yes, Madam Bones, I do," Percy answered, puffing out slightly.

"You do realize that to achieve that level of authority you will need foreign policy experience?" She asked carefully.

"I was hoping to get a diplomatic posting when an opening becomes available," Percy answered, pleased that the Minister was taking such an interest in his ambitions.

"Well then you are in luck. It just so happens that I have an important ambassadorial post open at this moment, and I think you would be the perfect man to fill it," she said with apparent sincerity.

Percy swelled with pride as he looked at his brother and sister condescendingly. "I would be honored, Madam Bones," he responded.

"I'm very happy to hear that. Because of the importance of the post I would have to ask you to leave immediately; would that be a problem?" She asked seriously.

"Absolutely not, I can leave at once," he responded proudly.

"Excellent," she said as she walked to the door and opened it. "Perkins, could you please step in here for a moment?"

A burly auror well over six feet tall stepped into the room and waited further orders. As Harry looked at the unsmiling face we was certain he never wanted to be on this man's bad side.

"I am sending Mr. Weasley on an important ambassadorial mission, and I need for you to escort him back to London and see that he's packed and ready to leave first thing in the morning. I want you to also arrange for all necessary transportation documents. This is of the greatest importance," she said firmly.

"Of course, Minister Bones," Perkins replied quickly.

Ginny Weasley thought that she was going to gag with the way that Percy was puffing himself up like a peacock. 'If Percy was bad before, he'll be impossible now,' she thought with disgust.

As Percy turned to leave the room he hesitated and turned back to face the Minister.

"Err…excuse me Madam Bones, but exactly where will I be ambassador to?" He asked.

"Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to mention it. Starting tomorrow you will be our new ambassador to the Gobi Desert," she said with a completely serious look.

A look of absolute horror appeared on Percy's face comprehension dawned on him. "The…the Gobi Desert; but there are no wizards in the Gobi Desert," he declared in disbelief.

"Nonsense Mr. Weasley; I'm sure that in the five years of your appointment you will find several. I wish to receive regular reports on your progress; I regard this of the highest importance," she said firmly.

Fred and Ginny could barely control their laughter at the look on Percy's face. "Five years?" He asked in disbelief.

"Of course Mr. Weasley; it will take you that long to familiarize yourself with the conditions in the region. I expect your first report to be on my desk in two weeks," the Minister ordered.

"Yes Minister," Percy said in a tone of complete defeat, and left the room with the auror.

The minute that the door closed Fred and Ginny burst out laughing; they had never seen their brother so completely lost, and it delighted both of them.</pre>

<pre>"The boy is a dark wizard!"

"Dermot! Someone hold on to him." Robert barked to his men as he tried to restrain Dermot from punching Crouch in the face.

"I'm dark?"

They all turned to see a fairly pissed off Harry standing there with his egg under his arm.

"You are a Parselmouth." Crouch spat. "The Dark Lord was one too. So was Salazaar Slytherin."

"And so was Saint Patrick you hypocritical bastard." Dermot shouted, still being held back by the NBCI men. "How the hell do ya think he got the snakes to leave Ireland?"

Dermot was never interested in learning, but when he heard that Harry and Saint Patrick shared the same ability, he immediately began to research. It was how he had landed a steady job at the magical zoo. He couldn't speak to snakes, dragons of wyverns, but they knew he was Harry's brother and he got a lot of respect for that.

"Hypocrites?" Crouch was outraged. "Are you saying we harbour dark wizards?"

"Well, you did name one of your school's houses after one, according to you at least." Robert smirked.

Honestly, what was Crouch supposed to say to that? He just spluttered on the spot.</pre>

<pre>Rose got a bit closer… it was so pretty. It hummed under her skin like sunshine. "So what are you making exactly?"

Harry had been humming but perked up a bit. "Well it's a bit complicated, but certain stones can be shaped into certain mathematically and magically significant shapes. In my world the most magically powerful shape was the seven pointed star cut. And if you were willing to risk it, you could then add blood silver to the stone to form runes. Any mistake at any point destroyed everything, and likely got you fired as well."

Harry waved his hand, moving another diamond brick. "But I can manipulate diamond and other gems. After they gave me examples I learned how to make the pattern for the seven pointed star… then the runes… then how to combine them."

He grinned. "I made one for my future home, a ward stone like this one. It required many masters of crafting to design it, and only I had the power to create it. It was nearly worshiped by the Jeweler Clan."

His hand waved in the air. "This will be a fairly large stone, 49 inches across, 7 layers each one inch thick, and seven rings of runes on each layer." He grinned at the shocked looks the goblins who crafted gave him. "Not only that, but they had done thousands of tests and calculations, determining distances, angles, and all kinds of things to make sure this was magically stable and sound."

He blinked at the stone. "Of course, my middle layer was made of Ruby, thanks to my account manager. Sneaky devil."

Sarah blinked. "Why ruby?"

Harry sighed. "Well it IS a great idea for a ward stone, and it help protects pregnant women, children, etc… but it also massively increase fertility." He grumbled. "Apparently several goblins REALLY wanted to ensure my line continued."

Sarah glanced at the King who was already nodding and grinned. "Well, sounds like we need some rubies then."</pre>

<pre>Harry winced as almost two thousand people started singing the school song at different speeds, volumes and differing levels of ability most of which went from horrible to merely bad while the sadistic headmaster smiled and gestured wildly. Harry blinked as he noticed something that annoyed him, ‘The bastard is wearing earplugs.’

+

Harry looked around at the students waiting outside, most of them looked at least second or third year while several of them were older. “I don’t think there are that many first year students here.”

Fred Weasley smirked as he looked up from his schedule, “That’s because there aren’t. Auto shop right?”

Harry said, “Yep, first year auto shop.”

“Yep, you’re good.”

“Then why are you here?”

A tall black haired man in a trench coat, top hat and with what looked like steam punk goggles stepped out of the tent, “Because mixing the years together means that there are plenty of more experienced people around to help you. I am Professor Frankenstein, yes, yes I‘m related to that Frankenstein.”

One of the other first year students asked in fear, “You’re related to the monster?”

“No the scientist. Get your facts straight kid. So if everyone will step inside I will explain a little bit about the course.” 

+

Puck asked, “Do you have any rituals that we can use now?”

Hermione said, “There are a couple we can do to enhance your physical body but they’re tricky and can go horribly wrong. Most of them shouldn’t be used on children though there is a flexibility ritual that is best used when you’re a teenager. Still, I’d rather wait until we’ve had a bit of practice with them.”

Luna said, “There are a couple of hundred Slytherins around that we could practice on.”

The last month and a half of being sneered at for being a Gryffindor had dropped Puck’s opinion of most of the Slytherins down to less than crap. At least crap helped plants grow. “We should be able to ask Tracey about the worst Slytherins. She came through on the twins.”

Hermione looked at Puck, “It’s probably against the rules to experiment on other students.”

“I looked it up, we just need their permission and a faculty member to sign off on our competency at the ritual we‘re using. That said, the ministry turns people into slaves why would I care what they think?”</pre>

<pre>Harry was confused by the obvious vitriol coming from Umbridge. He could see how she could be upset with him, but why did she send nasty looks to Remus, Fleur and Maxime? He would ask Remus about it later. He hard Dumbledore ask his menu for Pork Chops, and the Pork Chops suddenly appeared on his plate. Dobby had informed Harry beforehand of this way or ordering for the Ball and Harry had prepared a special surprise. Remus already knew and Harry told Luna to wait until everyone else had ordered. He whispered something into her ear and she smiled and said aloud, "Pudding and chocolate milk!"

To the shock of everyone at the table except for Remus and Harry, pudding and chocolate milk appeared before her. Everyone was surprised because pudding and chocolate milk wasn't on the menu. Remus than said aloud, "Filet Mignon, rare, roast potatoes and Brussel sprouts with bacon. Fire Whisky, aged one hundred and fifty years." More shocks as what Remus ordered also appeared before him. He took a sip of the Fire Whisky and let out a, "Oooh, smooth."

It was now Harry's turn to order and he didn't disappoint. "Farfalle with Creamy Wild Mushroom Sauce, Garlic Bread and Château Lafite-Rothschild 1869." Both Fleur and Maxime gasped at the last. Like the others, the requested food appeared before Harry. 'I'll have to remember to thank Dobby and Winky for this. The looks on the others faces is priceless. I'll have to show it to Sirius in the pensive later tonight. It looks like he was right about the wine, Fleur's and Maxime's eyes are about to bug out. I hope it tastes OK.' Everyone started to eat and Harry noticed that Hermione was giving him a look that said that they would be talking later. Harry loved the pasta and figured that he could get used to the taste of wine. Luna was enjoying her pudding and kept moaning as she ate. Harry had a little problem sitting, listening to her moans.

As the meal was halfway done, Fleur asked in a small voice, "Excuse me Mr Potter, would it be possible to try a little of your wine?"

Maxime looked to Harry and asked. "And would I be allowed a taste too? It is an amazing vintage and I don't believe that I will have another chance to try it."

"Sure, no problem." Harry said and a bottle and two glasses appeared before Fleur and Madame Maxime. "Enjoy."

Both of the girls jaws dropped and Maxime got out. "A whole bottle!? This is too much. All I wanted was a taste." Fleur was too shocked to speak.

"Well you can share it with the rest of the table if you like. Or save it for a special occasion, like Fleur's second place finish. I have three more cases of that year."

This snapped Fleur out of her shocked silence and she said, "Hey!" There were a couple of laughs around the table at her reaction.

Krum asked, "Is it a good wine?"

Harry responded, "I don't really know. Here." and a bottle appeared in front of Krum and Cedric. "A bottle for each champion." The whole table was silent. "What? I think it's an OK wine and you all wanted to try it."

Dumbledore spoke up, "Harry…"

Harry cut him off. "That's Lord Potter, Albus."

Dumbledore had an angry expression flash on his face for just a moment. Putting a fake smile on his face, he continued. "Of course, Lord Potter. I was trying to say that the wine that you just…gifted the other champion is an extremely rare and extremely valuable one. It is inappropriate to give such a generous… gift."

"Oh Pish Tosh. I have more than I could ever drink in my possession. They are actually helping me by making some more room in my cellars. But if you are so insistent, I won't give you a bottle. Don't want to offend your sensibilities." Harry said.</pre>

<pre>Harry walked to the front of the Slytherin and the Ravenclaw tables "Anyone in a house that has the dark mark has one hour from right now to get there things and depart Hogwarts. I will activate a special ward that will notify the staff you have been marked as a death eater. Marked death eaters are no longer welcomed at Hogwarts."

At the main hall entrance door at sickly "Hmm – Hmm." was heard and everybody turned to the noise. "Did I hear a student directly threaten the lives of other students?"

Harry looked at this woman and performed passive legimancy on her. He learned that Minister Fudge had sent her to watch Albus Dumbledore and to shut up Harry Potter by any means necessary as they were stating that Lord Voldemort had returned and Fudge was afraid that Albus wanted his job. "Who are you?" Harry asked her.

The Lady smiled sweetly "Excuse me young man but I believe I will be asking the questions here. As Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic…"

Tonks cut in "Did you just say you work underneath the Ministers desk?" The whole hall erupted in laughter.

The woman's cheeks burned red "I most certainly did not. I am a high valued member of his senior staff."

Hermione couldn't resist "Excuse me did I just hear you say you highly value the Ministers staff?" Again the students and then some staff started laughing hysterically.

Madam Umbridge finally started to lose her cool "Headmaster, are you going to allow students to talk to me this way? I am to be your replacement DADA instructor and I am to take my place as high Inquisitor."

Daphne smiled "Ma'am I find it highly dubious that an under the minister's desks secretary, who highly values the Minister's staff should cry like a baby to the headmaster to make someone listen to her." That was the last straw for madam Umbridge who whipped out her wand and then uttered "Crucio."

The spell sped towards Daphne who had a smile on her face as the spell hit her shield and cackled with magical energy before dissipating completely. Harry reacted quickly and disapparated to directly behind Madam Umbridge. He placed a dagger at her back and another under her chin "That was very stupid now drop your wand."

Umbridge reacted instantly and let her wand go. Hermione smiled sweetly at her and did a rather sick imitation of her voice "Hem- Hem excuse me madam but that was a very stupid thing to do especially since you are not even on Ministry or Human magical property."</pre>

<pre>Dumbledore broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge. It became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech. Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat back down smartly and looked alertly at Umbridge.

"Thank you, Headmaster," Professor Umbridge simpered, "for those kind words of welcome."

She moved to stand in the center, glancing across the sea of faces. Tom slowly floated down to Harry and brought his lips close to her ear.

"Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say! And to see such happy little faces looking back at me - "

"Death Eaters have taken over the school and one of them is giving a speech in Dumbledore's usual spot right now," Tom whispered.

Immediately, Harry's eyes shot open and she shot up from her spot, her hand snapping out in Umbridge's direction.

" - I am very much looking forwar - urk!"

Harry's silent, wandless, Stupefy slammed into Umbridge, sending her flying past the staff table and out the window.

Harry blinked blearily, and Hermione shrieked.

"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, her voice shrill. "You just sent our DADA professor out the window!"
Harry, still groggy from sleep, continued to stare blankly.

"Is this going to be a regular occurrence?" Dumbledore asked, an amused smile on his face. The first years were looking at Harry with wide eyes, while the older students just shook their heads and were talking quietly amongst themselves.

"Fifty points from Gryffindor, Potter," McGonagall said tiredly.

Harry shrugged. "Well, I'm a prefect, so… fifty points to Gryffindor. Go me."

Hermione swatted at her and McGonagall shot her a glare. "Seventy points from Gryffindor."

"Seventy points to - "

"Professor McGonagall, would you please make sure our latest professor is well," Dumbledore asked kindly.

_I don't see any Death Eaters. Who'd I knock out the window?_

"Toad lady from the Ministry," Tom said.

_Oh. She's an idiot. I don't mind taking out an idiot._

When McGonagall had exited the hall, Harry muttered under her breath, "Seventy points to Gryffindor."

"Ninety points from Gryffindor!" McGonagall's voice rang

"With that being said, however, I believe now is a good time for our students to head to their dorms," Dumbledore said.

"Right," Harry said, yawning. "Alright. Gryffindor First years, with me. Or else."

+

"Harry you have to go to detention," Hermione said at the Great Hall that night. Harry huffed and puffed, but Hermione wouldn't be persuaded. "You don't want to get expelled do you?"

Harry rolled her eyes and Fred and George (who were on either side of her) grinned. "Please. Dumbledore would never expel me. I'm pretty sure I could go on a killing rampage and he'd just offer me a lemon drop and start to ask me about my feeeeeeelings."

Tom covered his mouth to stifle a laugh.

"Now then, now then, now then," said Slughorn, whose massive outline was a bit blurred to make out with all the vapors in the air from the potions he had laid about. "Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making…"

"Sir?" ventured Harry hesitantly.

"Harry, m'girl?"

"My, uh…" Harry had the decency to blush sheepishly at this. "My hydra ate my textbook."

Knowing glances were exchanged between the students, while Slughorn's eyebrows drew up in surprise. "I thought you had a basilisk."

"Er… I have a hydra, too," Harry admitted. "Well, at least, I'm helping to raise him. He's, uh, started teething, so…"

"I see," was all Slughorn said, but it was quite clear he did not. "No matter, I have plenty of extra copies left. Go ahead and grab one from the cabinet over there!"</pre>

<pre>Harry padded across the floor and opened the door to the sight of his witch and her sister wearing complimentary tank tops and hip hugging gym shorts that were scandalously tight. Harry, unlike a normal eleven-year-old boy, found his eyes roving over the budding contours of Hermione's body seen—for all intents—for the first time. He felt his ears and cheeks grow warm.

"See something you like, mister 'The Great' Harry Potter, sir?" Hermione said in a very good imitation of Dobby but he doubted the house-elf would ever smile at him like that; at least he hoped not: it would be too creepy.

"Th . . . That's a different look for you, Mione," he hesitantly said and tried to look away, "your . . . um . . . workout clothes at Hogwarts aren't . . ."

". . . As tight or revealing?" She interjected in a very casual, relaxed and—to Harry's even greater discomfort—sultry tone; unlike anything he'd yet heard.

"Well . . . yeah; I guess," he managed, finally tearing his eyes from his bushy-haired friend. Unfortunately, his gaze fell on a similarly clad Danielle and while she had yet begun to fill out it was easy to imagine; after all, Lady Granger-Black was an extremely attractive witch. At least the young blue-eyed girl had a modicum of modesty; she was as pink in the face as Harry was.

"Stop ogling my li'l sis," mocked Hermione.

"I . . . I wasn't ogling, I just couldn't get over how much you two look alike; despite the different hair and eye colors, not to mention mothers," he said in defensive recovery as Danielle fretfully nibbled her bottom lip.

"You expect me to believe that codswallop," she teased, "I'm glad Dani slept on my side of the house; her virtue . . ."

". . . would've faced less peril over here, I'm sure," Danielle muttered absently; Harry and Hermione heard her and burst out laughing, the younger witch responded, tersely, "I wasn't trying to be funny."

+

"Potter!" They heard an unwelcome voice say from behind them.

Exasperated, Harry and Hermione turned, knowingly, towards the voice; Harry asked icily, "What now, Malfoy?"

Ignoring Hermione completely, Draco walked up to Harry and growled, "You and those filthy goblins turned my mother into an obscene whore! What! Did! You! Do!"

Harry could smell Draco's dinner, pungently wafting from the boy's too close mouth, but before he could say anything about that—or the annoying spittle—the young Slytherin was violently yanked away by someone's magic. The blonde wizard slammed into the wall and remained stuck a few feet from the floor; near the doors to the Great Hall. Stunned, the green-eyed wizard plainly saw that his annoying nemesis was having difficulty breathing, almost as if a great weight was pushing on his chest, and his look of utter terror. To Harry's left there rose a loud crackle and the smell of ozone, which demanded his attention: what he saw was both frightening and exciting and called to his primal instincts. Awed, Harry stared at his witch, whose hair—now highlighted with arcing electric-blue sparks—whipped about as if blown by a strong wind and, in her fury, Hermione was beyond beautiful in the young wizard's eyes.

"You foul, disgusting, loathsome cockroach!" Hermione hissed; low, menacing and cold: chilled by her tone and his arrival ignored, Professor Snape shivered as he listened to the young witch, "How dare you speak of our mother in such a vile manner! I've got a good mind to squash you like the bug you are; give me one reason not to! One reason not to put you out of my or Dani's or Narcissa-mum's misery and don't give me that 'my father will hear of this' shit: I don't care what that emaciated, effeminate and bollock-less coward might think or threaten; he has been measured and found wanting and all his gold will not buy the respect, which he or you believe you are owed."

From his place on the wall, Draco responded with merely mouthed words as air remained squashed from his lungs. His eyes glowed with the abject dread; which, according to his father, his hero—the champion of the pure-blooded proper folk—could instill. But that was before the half-blooded whelp (standing beside the filthy mudblooded horror who didn't yet know her place) had cheated the great Lord of his destiny.

"Granger! Remove Mr. Malfoy from the wall this instance!" Professor Snape ordered; skillfully hiding the reverence he suddenly felt for the muggle-born witch with the brilliantly manifested magic.

Hermione's glare shifted from Draco to Professor Snape and then back to Draco before, with an angry swipe of her hand, the young Slytherin flew from his place on the wall: unfortunately for Draco, Hermione took Professor Snape at his words but with an added twist, sticking Draco to the ceiling instead; at least he could breathe again, which quickly became apparent and annoying.

"Wait till my father hears if this, mudblood!" Draco yelled with his whiney voice; his godfather shook his head in resigned defeat. Is he impossible to teach; not to mention an utter fool? Severus Snape thought, uncharitably.

"Silence, cur!" Hermione growled and cast—without intention—a wandless silencing spell; she and Harry turned and began to walk away.

"Granger, finite your spells on Mr. Malfoy immediately and don't you dare walk away until you are dismissed; that goes for you too Potter!" Professor Snape yelled as the senior faculty who were attending dinner—Professor Dumbledore included—arrived to investigate the huge magical disruption, which Hermione's rage had created; the young magicals just turned their heads and glared at the Potions' Master.</pre>

<pre>By far the most common cases beyond the skills of an average wizard to treat involved magical plants and creatures. From incompetents trying to make their own Floo powder, to idiots growing dangerous plants for profit in their gardens, to airhead housewives unable to deal with magical pests... the list went on and on. Almost as common was spell damage, usually the result of incorrectly applied Charms and Transfiguration. Cosmetic magic held the lion's share of the blame, from underage witches trying out dubious beauty charms published in Teen Witch Weekly, to supposedly mature witches and wizards incorrectly applying bodily enhancements. In Andromeda's opinion, those unable to cast Enlargement Charms correctly but still tried to apply them to themselves should be left untreated so they couldn't pass on their stupidity to the next generation. Her own daughter had tried something similar with her Metamorph talents as a teenager - once. After some motherly advice given with love, she'd never repeated the attempt until after she joined the Auror academy. Recreational magic was also as bad. At least once a day they had to treat a witch or wizard of a serious overdose of Cheering Charms, Calming Charms, or creative applications of the Confundus Charm, such as that couple spelling themselves to enjoy any kind of food, no matter how disgusting or unhealthy. Idiots. At least fear of the Dark Arts kept the average witch or wizard from using them in a similar manner. Andromeda still recalled using the Imperius on herself to study or do her chores while feeling perfectly happy and not at all bored. It had been relatively harmless and landed her the position of Head Girl, but other family members had not been as fortunate.

"Healer Tonks, there's an old lady asking for you!" A mediwizard called out over the mad scramble of several Healers to handle two dozen rabid Quidditch fans who'd cursed each other over the Chudley Cannons' latest defeat. Professional Quidditch was yet another source of wizardly stupidity and work for Healers after all.

"Be right there, Roberts!" She replied, feeding some Restorative Draught to a dog-face Auror trainee who'd had a Polyjuice accident. Thank Merlin Potions accidents had slowly diminished in number over the past decade. Or rather, thank Severus Snape. The man's draconian teaching methods and utter unwillingness to coddle misbehaving or accident-prone students were slowly convincing the new generation not to experiment with Potions unless they absolutely knew what they were doing, not to make recreational use of Potions, not to attempt to brew their own Firewhiskey and so on and so forth. And while the number of applicants for new Healers had decreased significantly, they no longer had to turn down half of them for messing up a patient's medication with potentially lethal results. The Aurors had to be enjoying similar improvements; it had been four years since she'd had to treat one of them for trying to Polyjuice into a Veela for undercover work.</pre>

<pre>The silly romance plays they had on early to mid-morning were almost insultingly stupid. Only the worst sort of person would find themselves torn between a pair of equally disreputable lovers. How many times can one woman waver between a werewolf and a vampire, let alone consider either of them in the first place? She should just find herself a nice normal wizard and be done with it; the most she'd have to worry about then was boredom.</pre>

<pre>"Anyways…part of the whole mystique of Snorkack Hunting is the little that is known about it. There are many rules to it, and some will vary slightly, but everyone everywhere agrees on the first three rules."

"The first rule is you do not talk about Snorkack hunting."

Remus nodded. "Yes, yes. I heard that."

"The second rule is-"

Tonks shook her head. "Yes, yes. We heard that one too."

Kingsley wasn't too happy with the lack of respect the rules were getting.

"And the third rule of Snorkack hunting is…" Kingsley paused and saw his two friends making anticipatory frustrated faces. "Everyone is topless."

"What!" Tonks yelled while Remus just smiled and exclaimed, "Sweet!"

"It attracts the Snorkacks." Kingsley said with a shrug.

A couple of odd stares and Kingsley chuckled at the two. "I'm not entirely sure it's going to be the same sort of hunt for Harry. I think perhaps this is Lionel's way to trap a husband for his daughter more so than frat boys drinking in the woods with the ladies."

Remus looked a bit saddened. "Oh dear. Another old man manipulating Harry. He won't be pleased."

Tonks shook her head. "Umm, actually from what I gathered of Luna, Harry's going to be very pleased and probably quite often."

Kingsley smiled. "Yes. I think this is the sort of thing our self-sacrificing young Potter may be quite willing to forgive." Kingsley had a faraway smile of remembrance. "Boobs can do that to a growing boy."

Harry and Lionel landed with a crash and both of them fell to the floor.
"That was just as bad as a portkey, you big honking fibber!" Harry exclaimed as he got back to his feet.

"My apologies, Harry. That was in fact a portkey with a couple illusion spells built-in to the exit and disappearance. A trick my wife made up after watching Star Trek. Anytime we're in muggle inhabited areas, we just yell out, 'Beam me up, Scotty!' and can use them in front of anyone we please."

"Oh… so you just said that stuff to confuse the Headmaster?" A curious Harry asked.

"Yes, well that, and it seemed like pissing him off was one of your goals there, so I tried to do my part." Lionel explained while grabbing a can of frozen orange juice concentrate and a spoon.</pre>

"That's not Dumbledore," Harry warned. In a flash, every wand in the room was trained on the Headmaster.

"My dear boy . . ." Albus was taken aback by the accusation. "I assure you that . . ."

"My aunt can't stand me," Harry growled, "you shouldn't have tried that."

"If he moves," Frank said in a low voice, "kill him."

Moody was more then a bit amused as he watched his old friend attempt to deal with a house full of 'the worst sort of muggles' as Minerva would say. He couldn't remember the last time he'd had so much fun at the expense of another person.

"BUGGER THE GREATER GOOD," Harry's voice echoed through the neighborhood, "AND BUGGER YOU BLOODY GITS."

Moody watched with a smile as Dumbledore paid the Dursleys back for the fifteen minutes of hell that he'd spent with them. Albus stormed out of the house at number four a few minutes later with a look of disgust on his face.

"Decided to call things off early did you?" Moody asked calmly.

"Harry must be a bloody saint to have dealt with those people for so long without putting them six feet under," Dumbledore replied, "how could anyone be so . . . so . . ."

"Dursleyish?"

"Give them up to Amelia Bones with my suggestion that she investigate them for child abuse," Dumbledore said sharply, "and if by some miracle she doesn't find any evidence that they mistreated Harry . . ."

"Best you stop there," Moody said calmly, "and let me deal with the details."

"Bugger that fer a bag ah doughnuts," Dumbledore snapped, "if we're going to do some evil to those bastards then I want in on it."</pre>

<pre>Presence: Numerical representation of empathy, social aptitude, persuasion, and influence. The rank of an average social adult is arbitrarily set at 100. Total effect diminishes at square of rank under 100, and increases at cube of rank over 100 for the extent of the influence, but is linear for the strength of the influence when two people attempt social interaction in opposition. Harry Potter, with only 2 people close to him and less than a dozen people he frequently interacts with has Presence 20. A dictator or religious leader who personally manages to proselytize half a million followers through his speeches, acting skill, and guiding the masses despite his ideas being against social practices or even common sense would have Presence 1000. This is the primary attribute of dangerous beings such as Veela, Vampires, Politicians, and Lawyers.</pre>

<pre>Old Crow leaned back and considered his work. It was different than his usual stuff and that made him a little cautious.  It was almost like he was under an Imperious curse from another author!

Meanwhile, Voldemort waited in his Manor atop the hill, because that’s where the author of the story wanted him to be.

He paced his dark and stormy chamber, every so often kicking that damn snake because he hated snakes and really wished someone had let him have a bunny as a pet instead.

“A were-rabbit would have been nice!” he shouted. “But no! I have to get this slimey snake that eats, then throws up the bones. Do you have any idea what that does to the carpets in here!!!”

The doors burst open and his servant, Wormtail, rushed into the room, followed by all of his Death Eaters. The sudden inrush of over four hundred people made the room very crowded and Voldemort ended up being pinned against a wall by the crush of the crowd.

“Back! Back, you fools! Gods, why couldn’t you have given me smart henchmen, like that Doctor Evil character?”

Dropping to his knees, he crawled to his throne and climbed onto it. Once there, he pretended to be totally unaffected by the arrival of so many Death Eaters.

“Wormtail! Report!”

“Master, the townspeople are storming the castle gate!” Wormtail shouted.

Voldemort blinked in surprise, and then turned a steely gaze on Wormtail. “Are they really?” he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm, his fingertips drummed a staccato rhythm on the arm of his chair.

Wormtail shuffled his feet and looked down. “Well, no… not really, Master. I’ve just always wanted to say that.”

“I see. So what, then, is your real report?”

“Well, I am pleased to tell you that tonight we managed to execute our fifty-first pizza delivery guy for being late, Master.”

Voldemort looked up, pleased at the news. “MUHAHAHAHA!!! We shall conquer those fools after all!”

“Oh, and Harry Potter and some girl, who’s is at least a C cup, is outside planting explosives around the manor house.”

“My manor house?”

“Yes, my lord.”

“A C cup, you said? Wait! Explosives? Muggle things that go ‘boom’?”

“Yes, my lord, muggle things that go ‘boom’,” Wormtail replied, all the while thinking about doing a little boom-boom with Harry’s girlfriend.

Voldemort hunched down on his throne and pounded on one of the arms. “Curse you, Harry Potter! Why do you get girls with C Cups, while I’m stuck with Wormtail… who can’t even wear an athletic supporter!”

Snape looked around at the empty sky and started to scream like a girl as he dropped to the Quidditch pitch below. The students in the stands, seeing their favorite potions Professor dropping to his death, decided to take action. En mass, the students began to conjure all sorts of interesting things for Snape to land on - spikes, pits full of piranha borrowed from another chapter of this story, ground glass and even a few flaming pools of oil.</pre>

<pre>Voldemort stood absolutely still and looked at both the Malfoy men in turn, before his eyes settled on Draco. The Malfoy heir couldn't suppress a shudder as that icy gaze fell upon him.

"So, not only did you fail to secure the Vanishing Cabinet, you've let my most precious treasure fall into the hands of the enemy. I feel your usefulness has come to an end, young Draco."

"My Lord!" Lucius protested. "How could Draco have protected the object if he didn't even know it was there?"

"Silence, dog, or I will whip you, too," Voldemort spat. "Perhaps seeing the body of your son lying before your feet will convince you to do better in future!"

"No!" Lucius yelled as Voldemort drew his wand gracefully from his robes and pointed it at Draco. Not bearing to look, Draco closed his eyes.

"Avada Kedavra!"

Silence descended as Draco cringed in anticipation of the Killing Curse hitting him. It took some time before it occurred to him that something should have happened by that point. Warily, he opened his eyes and looked around.

Voldemort was standing in exactly the same spot he had been before, but crumpled on the ground before him lay the body of his father.

"How touching," Voldemort sneered. "You pathetic father thought that sacrificing his life would somehow save you, Draco. Then again, Lucius always was a fool. Still, this reminds me of a night long ago when a certain Muggleborn witch also threw herself in front of my wand to save her son. Sadly for Lucius, that witch was far wiser than he, and knew powerful, ancient magic. Lucius threw away his life for nothing."

"Lord… please don't kill me," Draco begged, falling to his knees and clutching at the body of his father. "I'm… I'm a Malfoy! We're a… an ancient and noble family. I can be of use to you!"

Then, Voldemort said something that cut through Draco's grief and revealed to him that his life had been a sham.

"You fucking purebloods," the Dark Lord sneered. "You always think you're so special."

Such was Draco's shock that he barely registered Voldemort point his wand at him again. Only when he saw the flash of green light did he realise that he was going to die. If he'd had time to think about it, he might have even welcomed the release from the misery his life had become.

+

A moment later, Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, both mounted on brooms, flew into sight and landed next to Potter and Weasley.

"Oh, Severus, have you betrayed me, too?" Voldemort said tragically.

"I was never your servant!" the hook-nosed man yelled, "I might have shared some of your visions at the beginning, but the day you killed Lily was the day I became your sworn enemy."

"Isn't it strange how love makes fools of men?" Voldemort pondered lightly.

"It also gives them strength and makes them more powerful than you could possible know, Tom," Dumbledore said firmly.

"You would certainly know about loving your fellow man, wouldn't you, Albus?" Voldemort sneered. "Tell me, did Grindelwald ever take pity on you and bend over?"

+

Then, to Voldemort's amazement, Potter began to summon magical energy to him. He watched in stunned silence as the troublesome teenager gathered incredible amounts of raw magic around him. Then, if this was not shocking enough, the Weasley girl began to do the same. Voldemort stared at them in shock, unable to believe that the two insignificant children possessed such ability.

Then he laughed. A loud, manic laugh that echoed off the walls of the castle.

"Oh, how wonderful!" he cried. "Such power! Such talent! My sweet, sweet, children, what a battle this will be! We will go down in legend! This will be the greatest magical duel ever fought. This castle will be levelled and we shall lay waste to the whole region. We may well crack the spine of the world with the power we unleash. What a spectacle!"

Almost trembling with anticipation, Voldemort began to summon more and more magic to him. Never before had he gathered such raw power, and the feel of it was intoxicating. Overhead, the skies blackened and flashes of lightning could be seen through the thick cloud. The very stones under his feet began to shake. What a magnificent event this would be: a defining moment when the world would sit up and take notice of the power of magic!

"No!" cried a voice and Voldemort staggered as something slammed into him. Looking down, he saw a pair of thin arms wrapped around his middle and, twisting around, he saw a battered and bloody Albus Dumbledore clutching onto him.

"Get off me, you old fool"

"No, Tom. I should have dealt with you years ago, and that was my greatest mistake. I have a chance to rectify that error now, and I won't waste it!"

Voldemort raised his wand to blast the old wizard away from him, but just as he was about to release his magic, he felt it slip away from him. Again, he pulled his magic to him, only to feel it wrenched away before he could utilise it. He staggered as Dumbledore dragged him backward.

Growling, Voldemort tried again, only for the same thing to happen. Suddenly, it occurred to him what was happening. The moment he summon the ambient magic to him, Dumbledore, using his own skill and talent, instantly pulled it away. Well, the injured old wizard wouldn't be able to keep that up long, not in his present condition. Howling in irritation as Dumbledore again dragged him off balance, Voldemort began to gather as much magic as he could.

"You old fool! Did you really think that you could…"

He never completed the sentence, as he unexpectedly felt a terrible lurch and he began to fall. Voldemort suddenly realised that Dumbledore had dragged him to the edge of the tower and pulled them both over the railing, which had been damaged earlier. Fighting down a brief surge of panic, he spread his hands and smiled. Dumbledore had obviously forgotten that he could fly, the old fool! He drew his magic into himself and prepared to slow his decent. Hopefully, he would be able to shake his foe off of him at the same time.

Nothing happened.

With a cry of anger, Voldemort realised that Dumbledore was again sucking his magic from him! He wouldn't be able to fly like this! He had to…

The ground came up suddenly and the two wizards impacted hard.</pre>

<pre>145. One of the male students dies and becomes a ghost. He begins haunting the Great Hall, Myrtle joins him, and let's just say they don't need to find a new name for the much happier Myrtle.

"It's your fault I died!" Harry's ghost bellowed down at Dumbledore. "Your fault I . . ." a grin appeared on the ghost's face. "Okay, that's enough recovery, ready for round sixteen?"

Dumbledore sighed, ever since Harry had died he hadn't gotten a moment's peace. The ghost wasn't so bad, only really bothered him during meals and he could always eat in his office to avoid it. No, rather it was . . .

"Harder!" Myrtle screamed. "Oh yes!"

All the howlers he got from angry parents. You'd think they'd be happy the school had started a comprehensive course on practical sex education, but the reaction he'd gotten the one time he'd pointed that out had been anything but.

244. Harry uses his natural cunning to get out of having to do anything during the Triwizard.

"I refuse to go into that room with the other competitors unless all the judges agree that this is an official Triwizard Task that I have to complete."

. . .

"I'm not going to any sort of wand weighting unless the judges agree I have to because it's an official Triwizard Task that I have to complete," Harry said stubbornly.

. . .

"I'm not waitin in no tent-"

"Unless it's an official task, yes?" Bagman sighed. Why did the little bastard have to be so difficult?

. . .

Harry stepped out of the tent with a grin. "You may as well get rid of the dragon, I'm not going to do anything with it."

"You have to, it's one of the official tasks," Dumbledore said.

"Of which I have to do three to complete the tournament, right?" Harry persisted. "You all agree, right?"

"Yes! Now get on with it!" Igor growled.

"I did all three official tasks you told me to," Harry said smugly. "I went into the room, I got my wand weighed, I waited in the tent, and, since I finished first, I win."

"The first one out of the tent was-"

"Irrelevant. The judges said they were tasks that I had to complete. Didn't say anything about the other competitors having to complete them," Harry interrupted. "But feel free to disagree, I look forward to seeing what the cup will do to the Judges and organizers for trying to break their contract with me." The boy's eyes were eager. "Are you refusing to follow the contract?"</pre>

“He’s dead?”

“Oh yes… him, his family and the rest of the Slytherin team.”

Harry stared at Fred, “What happened?”

“Someone rammed his broom up his ass, through his neck and into his skull…”

Harry’s stomach twisted slightly as a perfect image of Malfoy with his broom stuffed so far up his ass that it killed him popped into his brain as if a memory. 

George scowled, “Waste of a perfectly good set of brooms.”

“Wait… the whole quidditch team?”

Fred nodded, “Yeah…”

“That’s sick… what happened to his parents?”

George sighed, “They were dipped in molten gold.”

“Not sure if that’s better or worse… still sick.”

<pre>Everything had been perfectly relaxed for once, until Hermione and Ron had started arguing on the far side of the room.

They'd been whispering to begin with, and so Harry had closed his eyes and ignored them, but their murmuring had grown so heated that they'd briefly awoken Katie, though only for long enough for her to transfigure a cushion into a very stylish, pink pair of earmuffs, and he'd been unable to help but overhear.

Apparently Ron took exception to the fact that he was the third party in the relationship Hermione had with the library, and had finally worked up the nerve to tell her that he'd prefer it if they spent a little more time together.

Hermione had invited him to study with her, and that had escalated the pitch to the point at which Harry wouldn't have not been able to overhear if he had tried.

It was small wonder that the common room was so empty.

'Hey,' the girl behind the counter perked up suddenly, 'aren't you-'

'Voldemort,' Harry nodded, interrupting the girl mid question, 'but ssssh, I'm in disguise, it's so hard to get good chocolates when you're committing mass murder and organising a blood purist revolt.'

<pre>"Most of our House are inbred cretins."

Severus Snape nodded in response to Salazar's growled comment as he sat down in the most comfortable chair, his robes billowing dramatically as he did so. Salazar merely smirked in appreciation of the dramatic effect.

"Indeed, since your portrait vanished three centuries ago, your House has gone inexorably towards the Dark."

"Minions, half of them are idiotic minions." Salazar exclaimed. "Like those two gorillas that follow Draco around. At least he has potential."

Severus lifted an eyebrow. "When did you come across gorillas? Three centuries ago, there were none outside Africa."

"Potion ingredient hunting in my youth." Salazar shrugged. "I mistook them for the natives for a while, I was young back then."

Severus nodded. "I see. Back to what you were saying, I agree. Quite a few of my House are dunderheads. I suspect inbreeding."

Salazar snorted. "I agree."</pre>

<pre>Dumbledore was not having a happy day. Yeah, sure he was able to leave the infirmary, but it had not come without a price.

Stepping out and turning toward where his office was, he set the bottom of his cane firmly on the floor.

"Now, Headmaster, I want you to use this for at least two weeks. Your leg still has some mending to do, no matter how much you try to deny it," Pomfrey said.

Dumbledore fought back a sigh, glancing down at his cane.

He might have liked it if not for the fact he supposedly needed it. Taking a few steps, he glanced down at it again.

The head of it was a phoenix; the grand wings folded back, allowing for Dumbledore's hand to comfortably wrap around its body. Its head was proudly raised and easy to see. It was a rather dignified cane at least, he thought, suddenly thankful Minerva had taken the time to personally get him a cane, rather than leaving it to Pomfrey, who probably would have given him a walker instead.

She was that cruel. But he supposed he was being too hard on Pomfrey, not that that would stop him from charming his cane...

Finally in his office, he sat down and pulled out his wand. After waving it over the golden phoenix a few times, he was confident he had done what he wanted.

The phoenix would now give a call whenever he didn't know Pomfrey was near, alerting him to her presence.

+

But before any of them could reply, Dumbledore's phoenix cane gave a trill. Ron's eyes grew wide as Dumbledore immediately put his cane down and leaned on it as if he had been using it the whole time.

"Headmaster, I was just looking for you!" Madam Pomfrey said, coming around the corner.

Ron nearly choked as she made her way to them. Hermione and the others glanced at Ron in confusion. What was he laughing at?

"Ah, Madam Pomfrey, I was just talking about the delicious desserts we have to look forward to," Dumbledore said as Pomfrey looked at the cane firmly planted on the floor in approval. "Is there something you need from me?"

"You need to take these before dinner tonight. Knowing how quickly dinner moves along in the Great Hall, I thought it best I give you these beforehand," she said, handing him a tablet and a small potion bottle.

"What are these for again?" Dumbledore asked, barely preventing himself from showing his dislike of whatever these things were.

"The pill will help your leg muscles strengthen further, and the potion will help with your tendons and such."

"Hm. You sure they are necessary?" he asked, looking at them uncertainly.

"Albus, yes. Must you always ask?"

"I am always hopeful the answer will change."

"You're hopeless, Headmaster," she said, before walking away and shaking her head.

O o O o O

Harry cast the necessary spells on himself as Ron and the others readied the room.

"Hey, Ron, before I forget, what was so funny before dinner, when we were with Dumbledore and Pomfrey in the hall?" Harry asked.

Ron stifled a chuckle, or tried to. "His cane-" he managed, suddenly no longer able to hold in his laughter.

"What?" Draco asked, the others now really curious.

"The phoenix," he said, calming down a little. "I don't think there's a way for me to translate it exactly, but . . . man, it's so great!"

"What Ron, what are you talking about?" Hermione asked, trying not to get annoyed about not knowing what was so funny.

"Dumbledore put an alarm on his cane!"

"An alarm?" Neville asked. "Why?"

"To warn him when Pomfrey is near!" He began laughing again. "When it trilled it said something along the lines of 'Ahh! Crazy nurse is close! Use me!' Man, I wish I could give you a better translation, but I just can't."

The others were now laughing, now understanding what Ron found hilarious.

"Hey, do you think he's put one on about Voldemort?" Greg asked.

"That would be great, I wonder what it would say?" Neville asked.

"'Grr! Evil psychopath is near! Blast him!'" Ron shouted, before falling into another fit of laughter.</pre>

<pre>"Who are you, really?" James asked again, eyes confused and wary.

"I'm Harry Potter." He smiled back at the man who was his alternate self's father. "The Mad twenty-five year old who managed to create an entirely new species by the age of sixteen." He paused, looking around. "Not that I created them, of course. That would've been irresponsible. And completely insane. And possibly liable for spending time in Azkaban for ruining the ecosystem. So, obviously, that never happened."

None of the three Potters present appeared to believe him, but that was alright, since as long as he continued to plead his innocence, nobody would actually arrest him.

Partly because one of the side-effects of the squirrels ruining the ecosystem had been that an extremely dangerous non-local magical beast that classified human flesh as a delicacy was given 'natural' enemies, and partly that nobody would ever be able to create a horcrux ever again, without the little blighters slaughtering them.

The final part of the equation was because Harry was... well, Harry, and attempting to arrest him would more than likely end with Azkaban exploding, the Dementors getting dressed up as mimes, the Ministry being flooded with animated plastic ducks, and Hogwarts growing dreadlocks.

It wouldn't be the first time he'd made an inorganic building grow a hairdo, and it probably wouldn't be the last.

So, Harry was immune to being arrested for as long as he didn't kill people indiscriminately – the clause of self-defense meaning that he did have some leeway – and didn't admit that he'd created the nasty little buggers who did kill people. It was a very comfortable arrangement all around.

Not quite as good as what Neville had gotten though. Since the guy was hired as a Hogwarts Professor, the only requirement the Ministry had put on his experiments with Herbology was that none of them were to eat or seriously maim one of his students.

Neville enjoyed mocking him over it sometimes, but he'd stopped after Harry had begun tampering with herbivores. Apparently, he knew not to provoke the Mad Scientist with access to his own Mad creations' greatest weakness. Genetically enhanced bunnies.

They still launched a few small-scale attacks on each other's labs though, for tradition's sake.

Susan thought the attacks were great fun, but Hannah was rather peeved about their friendly assassination attempts after they'd accidentally woken her up in the middle of the night once.

Harry sometimes thought it was a bit unfair that Neville had managed to secure two Mad Scientist Assistants, whilst Harry had never been able to recruit even one, but he supposed that it wasn't that bad.

Inferi were really good at hitting power-switches, and if you designed them juuuust right, you could make them cackle insanely in a very flattering way. Perfect assistants, really. Though, understandably, there was less sex in his lab as a result. A shame, but it was a sacrifice he was willing to make.

"What is wrong with you?" Lily finally asked, staring at him with something akin to horror.

Harry blinked. "Wait, what were we talking about? I got distracted thinking about punching Neville on the nose for having more sex-friendly lab-assistants than me."

"You admitted to creating monsters, before saying that you never made them, and that nobody could prove anything since it might get you sent to Azkaban." Clyde helpfully filled in.

Harry knew there was a reason he liked the shit-faced little turd. "Oh, right! I remember now. That never happened by the way." He paused, looking thoughtful. "But you might want to not provoke any squirrels you see in the future, you never know when a Mad Scientists might come along and start messing around with squirrel-DNA using magic."

James was gaping like a fish, the wand in his hands hanging rather limply from his fingers at the sheer oddness of the man in front of him. Lily's eyes were wide, and she looked moments away from calling for the aurors. And Clyde stared at him with slow, unblinking eyes.

"You're crazier than Padfoot." The boy breathed in awe.

Harry frowned, turning a glare at the boy. "Padfoot? Is he a Mad Scientist capable of turning the world's ecosystem on its head? Did he ever get banned from Azkaban for asking to dissect one of the Dementors?" Harry sneered down at Clyde's wide-eyed form. "No? Then I'm insulted that you would compare my hard-earned Madness with such an utterly boring individual."

+

Clyde frowned. "But what if you don't like to dissect people?"

Harry hummed thoughtfully as he tried to remember what Neville's approach to it had been. "Well, if you're a Mad Herbologist-type Scientist, then I suppose it would be to attempt to turn them into fertilizer. But I'm not an expert on that particular branch of Evil Madness, so I'm not sure." He admitted finally.

"So, you only work with animals?" The boy blinked curiously.

"Mostly." Harry nodded. "I did try to branch out to bugs, but my inferi didn't have good enough motor control to help me dissect such small things."

"You made inferi?" James gasped in horror.

"Kind of. It's a personal recipe." Harry shrugged with an careless expression. "They're the only lab assistants who don't spend all of their time drooling over my stuff. It's really really hard to find properly Evil help these days." He sighed. "They just keep trying to take off my clothes, or take off their clothes, or invite their siblings who also take off their clothes." He shook his head in frustration. "How am I supposed to do Science when there're clothes all over the damn floor?!" He demanded angrily.

"What did you make the inferi out of?" Clyde asked with a tilted head, obviously not understanding why his father was now staring at the insane man with a mixture of disbelieving horror and envious awe. Clyde thought that it made perfect sense that clothes on the floor would make science really difficult to do, and that people stripping all over the place would get frustrating when you wanted them to hand you things.

"Meat, the cheapest bones available, tinfoil, glass, toenail-clippings, and a few potions. I wasn't allowed to rob graveyards after that one time that I tried to bring Crookshanks back to life, you see." He made a face. "I honestly did not expect him to be that good at continuing his line. If I did, I would've made sure that he was neutered before I sent his patched-up body onto the roof of the tower in the middle of a thunderstorm." He shook his head at the memory of the kittens that the undead cat had managed to spawn.

Merlin only knew where they'd gotten that strange, crumpled-looking horn of theirs from.</pre>

<pre>Severus sighed at that but didn't have a chance to reply before the pair stopped before Madam Bones, the head of the DMLE was speaking to one of the students in a firm tone but it was obvious she was beyond stressed out at this point. The ginger she'd been interviewing looked a bit drawn out himself but much to Severus' surprise he wasn't a stuttering a mess, Madam Bones turned to address the new arrivals and greeted them with a nod.

"Headmaster, Professor, I was just having a rather interesting chat with young Mister Weasley here, apparently outside of a few...isolated instances most of the students survived their little misadventure with nothing more severe then broken bones. It would appear that the students also led a counter offensive against the attacking Death Eaters, there were no survivors from You-Know-Who's forces."

Both men wore mixed looks of shock at this, Severus himself was mildly impressed while Dumbledore looked more saddened then before, Ronald for his part just nodded in agreement with the stern looking woman.

"Yeah a few of us formed groups and cleared them out best we could while we gathered survivors, Neville Longbottom and Cedric Diggory for sure led their own umm...squads I guess you'd call 'em?" The freckled boys face shifted to a look of deep pride as he continued his explanation, "I was with Lillith Potter, blimey that girl can be scary when she wants to be." Suddenly giving the boy all his attention Severus drawled out,

"How so Mister Weasley?" Gulping as the embodiment of terror for most Gryffindors glared at him Ronald shifted his gaze to Dumbledore who nodded once, the boy turned his eyes back to the Potions professor as he continued.

"Well I was cornered by a pair of 'em, they recognized me as a Weasley and hit me with a spell that...well it hurt alot, crotia...cruci...I don't quite remember honestly, was screaming quite a bit at that point." All three adults looked ashen faced at this as Dumbledore calmly asked,

"Dear boy was it something like 'crucio'?" Ronald nodded quickly at that causing Severus to grimace, he was all too aware of how that curse felt,

"Right that, anyway after they hit me with that they began taunting me, then Lillith came out of no where and stabbed one of 'em in the head while her pet snake bit the other," Dumbledore gasped at that while Madam Bones brow furrowed.

"Pet snake mister Weasley?" Ronald nodded quickly while glancing once to Severus as if afraid what he'd say would get him in trouble, and in previous years perhaps it would but they'd intended for the school at large to find out about Lillith's parselmouth ability this year. Really there was no other way they could justify a meter long fire breathing snake following her around,

"Yeah, her Emberscale Nelle, anyway her knife got stuck in the first blokes head and the one who got bit was going to curse her when her back was turned so I caught him on fire, then her snake finished him off." Albus looked mournful at this revelation as he placed a hand on the teens shoulder,

"My dear boy I'm so sorry you had to take a life," the aged Headmaster was about to say something more but the ginger shrugged in indifference before he could continue,

"Eh, three really, although technically I suppose that first one was an assist," Dumbledore gaped at that as Severus raised a single eyebrow,

"And how did you accomplish this Mister Weasley?" Shrugging again the boy looked as if he was about to fall over, apparently the days deeds had finally caught up with him,

"Bombarda curse, it was...alot messier then the book made it out to be..." At this Amelia actually looked a bit confused and asked for clarification,

"The bombarda curse Mister Weasley? As in the explosion spell?" Nodding once while his brow furrowed a bit over the question he replied quickly,

"Yeah, we were told to buy some other books for our DADA class aside from the text, now normally you wouldn't catch me reading in the summer but I'm trying to bring my grades back up and the titles well...I was curious, good thing too..." Albus looked a bit confused at this, apparently he hadn't read this years book lists before they were sent out,

"Do you recall what the books titles were?" Ronald nodded quickly face brightening slightly,

"Kinda hard to forget Headmaster, first one was 'Stunners Are For Suckers' and the second was 'Kill It With Fire: 101 Ways To Fight the Dark Arts with Everyday Spells'," Amelia made a choking noise at that and quickly thanked the boy before dismissing him. Turning back to the two professors she removed her monocle and began rubbing her eyes, sighing out in exasperation she finally spoke up.

"Dumbledore...why were your students assigned Auror level training manuals written by Alastor 'Bloody Fucking' Moody?" For the first time in his life Severus Snape bore witness to the great Albus Dumbledore being at a loss for words, he'd have to share this memory with Lilly later; making a note to buy some popcorn he dismissed himself to find his daughter.</pre>

He kept this up for a few hours, eventually around the seven thousandth butterbeer the man in the cell across from him screamed,

"OH MERLIN I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!" And with that he charged headfirst into his cell wall, there was a sick thump as his skull was dashed upon the masonry then his body fell to the ground twitching, letting out several barks of laughter Sirius picked up his rusty shiv and scratched a new tally mark into the granite cell wall.

<pre>"Merlin!" the hat exclaimed a short while after being set on Harry's head.

"I don't think that's an option," Harry answered in the echoing silence that followed.

To understand the hat's exclamation, it is required to understand what young Harry was thinking as the hat settled over his ears. Now, thought processes are sometimes disjointed and confusing, but it was going something like this:

"So the cowards go to Gryffindor because they want to be brave, the people with no social skills are in Ravenclaw where no one will mind if they bury themselves in books, the ones who want to be big some day but still haven't figured out how they'll get there are in Slytherin and really the only people worth knowing at the Hufflepuffs who everybody else thinks are a bunch of duffers. This whole society seems set up to make sure people have very few friends and there doesn't appear to be anybody who is truly impartial in this school, as the teachers were no doubt students here as well and will therefore grant special treatment of some kind to their old house. Then there's the whole racist issues that are no doubt rife throughout the whole school, as they couldn't survive into the adult realm if they weren't encouraged somehow, either by turning a blind eye or actively supporting the view. And there looks to be only ten teachers for seven years of students, plus that unpleasant-looking man skulking in the corner and Mr Hagrid, makes a total of twelve. There are approximately forty students in the incoming year, and if that is taken to be average then that's two-hundred-and-eighty students in total and while that's not a very big school, it still means that the students outnumber the staff by a little over twenty-three to one. Okay, twenty-three isn't so bad in a controlled environment like a muggle classroom, but there's no way that all of the classes here are going to be so well controlled, not with magic involved. Further more, this is a boarding school, so there's a lot of time that the students won't be in classes and a lot of time for uncontrolled circumstances for the students to get the best of their teachers. That's not even including the castle itself which will work against the teachers because the students are smaller and able to hide better in the many passages that no doubt exist here and the teacher's can't be alert all the time without going mad. Something really needs to be done about this place before the system fails the students even more than I have no doubt it's already doing."

It was at this point that the hat yelped its cry across the hall, and Harry's following response, both of which have already been mentioned above.

The hat coughed, and it actually sounded embarrassed. "Yes, you are quite right Mr Potter. However, considering your mind, I rather think that I should commune with Lady Hogwarts herself for a moment, so if you would please put me on the floor?"

Harry reached up and pulled the hat off his head and set it down in front of him.

"Thank you," the hat said, and was silent for about as long as it took for the students to ask each other "do you have any idea what's going on?" and get head-shakes in reply.

"Mr Potter," the hat announced. "Will be placed as the new headmaster of Hogwarts. Albus, you are excused."

Silence set in heavily.

"But I came hear to learn magic," Harry pointed out calmly. "Not run the school."

"And so you shall, Mr Potter," the hat assured with a chuckle, somehow shifting itself around on its brim where it was still sitting on the floor, "but at your own pace in between running the school. The headmaster's office is full of portraits of previous headmasters, and they shall be your tutors until you reach your OWL and NEWT levels."

"And for now?" Harry asked. "Where am I supposed to sit?"

The hat looked like it was grinning. "Why, in the headmaster's chair, of course."

Behind Harry, Albus Dumbledore spluttered indignantly.

"Albus, the house elves have already packed your things for you," the hat called out.</pre>

<pre>"Shouldn't you go find a Professor or something?"

"And leave you here unattended? Points for the effort, Potter." She said dryly. Retrieving parchment and quill from her purse, she summarized the situation in a few words, lifted her wand, and focused as strongly as she could on a certain image in her mind.

"Accio Dumbledore's Hat!"

A few seconds passed, during which Harry stared incredulously at her, and then the hat in question came in through the door. She stuck the message into it with the basic Sticking Charm, fixed the Headmaster's image firmly in her thoughts and cast again.

"Depulso Dumbledore's Hat!"

The hat flew off again, returning to its original position. "You know," she said conversationally while Harry still gaped "there must be a better way for witches and wizards to send messages to each other. This one won't work if the target is more than a few miles away, and the enchanted mirror Neville got from his grandma is one of a pair, limiting that method between two preset individuals."

"You summoned the Headmaster's hat!" Harry exclaimed.

"I don't think he'll mind, Harry." She said testily. "In this at least we agree, he and I; you're rather important." She sighed. "I think we got a minute or two before he arrives. Why don't you tell me exactly how you got hurt. I need to know who to dismember for this, you know."</pre>

<pre>Ten feet tall if it was an inch, it had to bend down to avoid its head smashing into the ceiling. Its thick robes hung low over its head, hands, and feet, concealing them from sight and the sense of dread most everyone felt in any dangerous and unexpected but unknown situation magnified a hundredfold at its appearance. And then it took in a slow, heavy, rattling breath and Susan paled. Hands and feet shaking, the previously confident girl almost collapsed on her seat. The others took several steps back -even Cedric- and the screaming in Valeria's ears intensified. What the hell? Who'd called in the Nazgul?</pre>

<pre>"My bloody head hurts just listening to those descriptions." The redhead frowned. "It would be cool to be an auror though, wouldn't it?"

"Yeah... it's not as if we aren't already doing their job." Five of their group snickered but Valeria actually laughed.

"Ron, your habitual laziness knows no bounds." She shook her head. "A lazy auror is a dead auror because no Dark wizard or witch worth their salt could even share that flaw and survive dabbling in the Dark Arts. They're driven to succeed through any means and that's why they do what they do."

"You think I can't do it? I can do anything I put my mind into!" The redhead shouted, face crimson. Ignoring Harry's attempts to calm him down, he spoke on nastily. "And that description of Dark wizards? Sounds exactly like you, if you ask me." Right, because she should let Harry be abused during summer. Or allow Malfoy to take his moronic prejudices out on anyone he can get his hands on. Have the Dark Wanker return to power through an artifact, or let Dumbledore and his idiotic beliefs destroy the heritage of the Wizarding World. No, thank you.

"Whatever, Weasley." She said, annoyed. "I'll bet you a hundred galleons that you and Harry won't do well in the lessons that'll help you be an Auror. You're good in Defense and can manage in Charms and Transfiguration, but you'll be poisoned in your first mission with your Potions marks. Someone will mail you a letter with a rune-based exploding hex and you'll die, or be eaten by a Manticore in a raid, since your first elective choices were Muggle Studies and Divination because they're easy." She laughed again. "Tell you what. Pick Runes, Care, and any one other elective you want. Do well in the first two and fix your Potions marks by this time next year - without your other marks dropping, mind you - and you win those one hundred Galleons. Fail though, and you have to stand on top of the Gryffindor table during dinner and shout 'I am the stupidest student, ever!' for the whole school to hear. Deal?"

"You're on, Campbell!" He said with a gleam in his eye. She was all but certain their other friends had noticed what she was doing but no-one spoke a word. Even Harry nodded to her where Ron couldn't see but she didn't need that approval. If she had to use his family's poverty to make Ron into a better person, she'd do it again in a heartbeat. "Hey, what electives are you choosing?"

"All of them, Weasley." She said, smile widening at his gobsmacked expression. "The future Grand Sorceress can't have any gaps in her magical knowledge now, can she?"

"That's... that's Dumbledore's job!"

"He won't be alive forever." She smirked. "Besides, I'f fairly sure he's not a Grand Sorceress, Weasley. The beard is kind of a giveaway."</pre>

<pre>She cast a softening charm on her own rock cake and pondered the problem while munching on delicious homemade goodness. She was a witch - why should a minor flaw in Hagrid's cooking prevent her from enjoying it? Besides, it probably wasn't a flaw at all; being a half-giant almost certainly meant normal foodstuffs would seem too soft and gooey to her large friend so he compensated accordingly. His full-blooded relatives had been known to munch on muggle knights in full plate armor back in the day, after all.</pre>

<pre>"Weasley, you're sure you could win this if we had an extra piece or two?" she asked.

"Of course but..." he looked at the chessboard and then at her. "What do you have in mind?"

"Those who can't do, cheat." she paraphrased as she raised her wand.

Professor McGonagal had certainly programmed all the rules and her knowledge of chess into the pieces. Break the rules and the pieces would attack. She'd also expect a direct attack - try to harm the pieces or force the far door and they'd probably mob you. But there was one thing left she might not have thought of.

"Colovaria!"

The only pieces that were exactly the same between the two armies were the pawns, apart from their color; every other piece was distinctive. But even pawns, at the right place and the right time, could make a critical difference. So Valeria used the Colour-Change Charm on one of them. There was resistance, something pushing against her magic. But this one charm was the first she'd gotten right with a wand, the first she'd made into an enchantment, the first she'd applied on a living being permanently. The resistance was overwhelmed, and one white pawn turned black. No pieces reacted; this wasn't an event their creator had predicted. She sighed in relief.

"Think you can win this now?" she asked.

"What... you... how?" the redhead strategist frowned at the chessboard and nodded. "Yes... I think this will do."</pre>

<pre>There was a short silence as Harry carefully constructed himself a bacon sandwich from the nearby platters of breakfast, liberally cramming bacon between his slices of toast.

'I'm not sure you'll be able to bite that,' Neville remarked, watching as he ate a less ambitious breakfast of sausage and poached eggs.

'I can certainly try,' Harry countered, stretching his jaw to encompass the sandwich. It was a bit far to be comfortable. 'Maybe I should cut it,' he sighed, reaching for his silverware.

'Probably for the best,' Neville agreed, 'you don't need to substitute for Ron's table manners when he's away.'

'My sincerest apologies,' Harry replied dryly. 'So what are you doing today? Nobody comes back until tomorrow.'

'Professor Sprout offered to let me help her in the greenhouses,' Neville smiled, 'I brought Hannah to show to her.'

'Hannah?' Harry blinked. 'That's not how you introduce your girlfriend to people Neville, but congratulations for finally asking her out, everyone knows you like Miss Abbott.'

Neville let out a very undignified squeak and turned the colour of a rather overripe pomegranate. 'I named my mimbulus mimbletonia Hannah,' he admitted in a small voice.

'Oh,' Harry realised. 'Well if you want my advice I'd make sure Hannah, the girl that is, knows how much you love your cactus, before she finds out you named a slimy, spiky, stinky sap shooting monster of a plant after her and takes it badly.'

'You think she won't like it,' Neville gulped.

'I think she'll like it once she knows how much you love the plant,' Harry mediated. 'If she doesn't know that, though, then you're going to be spending a whole lot more time with the less attractive, green version of Hannah than with the pretty, pig-tailed one.' Neville had continued to colour reaching a very splendid shade of Gryffindor crimson as Harry talked.</pre>

<pre>"So, you want to learn to resist the Imperius Curse," Moody mused. "I warn you, lass, it ain't easy. Your friend here is the only one who pulled it off. Most people, the best they can do is learn what it feels like and break out of it when their attacker's concentration lapses."

Hermione frowned. She would have thought it would be more of a direct battle of wills. But still, she said, "That's better than nothing."

"Alright, then," Moody said. He pointed his wand, and Hermione had to force herself not to react as he said, "Imperio."

Suddenly, an amazing sense of calm came over her. All her worries were washed away, and she was happy and relaxed like she hadn't felt since…she honestly couldn't remember, but what did it matter? Perhaps those lazy summer days before she ever came to Hogwarts. It felt so freeing not to have to worry about Harry or any of her other problems. But shouldn't she be worried about Harry? Nah. The thought was wiped from her head before she could fully think it.

Somewhere in the background of her mind, she heard Moody's voice: Do a cartwheel.

Why not? She thought. She was having such a good time already. Never mind that she hadn't done a cartwheel in years. She took the proper stance and spun head over heel like she was five years old again.

Dance an Irish jig, Moody commanded.

Hermione didn't know any Irish jigs, but the steps came to her unbidden, and she started dancing.

Get down on all fours and bark like a dog.

Now that's a little demeaning, isn't it, some still-functioning part of her brain thought. I think I'll pass on that one.

Get down on all fours and bark like a dog.

Oh, very well. She played her part, and then Moody abruptly broke off the curse.

"Ah!" Hermione yelped and jumped to her feet, taking a few cautious steps back from the old Auror.

"You okay, Hermione?" Harry asked.

"Am I okay?" Hermione repeated absently. "Ugh. I feel like I took a big whiff of laughing gas. That spell really messes with your head." To be honest, she really felt…violated after that, even though she'd asked for it. The symptoms were much the same as nitrous oxide, though: euphoria, detachment from the self and from reality, suppression of worry, and suggestibility. She thought she understood, now. There were other, milder spells that could influence people, but the curse part of the Imperius Curse was that it suppressed the will. So it wasn't a battle of wills, but a rout that only the very strongest—people like Harry—could fight off.

But Moody didn't look wholly disappointed. "You have the spark there," he said. "You hesitated at the end. You could probably fight it if you really pushed it."

"Really, Professor?" Hermione cleared her head and thought it over. "Could I try it again, then? Now that I know what it feels like, I might be able to do better."

"If you say so," he replied. "Imperio."

The floating, euphoric feeling came over her again, but this time, the voice in the back of her mind was telling her, Effects like nitrous oxide. Don't shut down completely. Keep a scrap of your wits about you.

Moody began to command her again: Skip around the classroom.

No, I'd really rather not.

Skip around the classroom.

Hermione skipped, but it was with a tinge of reluctance—a crack in the perfect contentment imposed by the curse.

Sing opera.

No way, I can't sing.

Sing opera…sing opera.

No. I play piano. I should've taken up violin. I don't sing.

Sing opera…SING NOW!

Hermione coughed under the force of the command and began belting out a truly terrible rendition of "O Mio Babbino Caro". She might not have been a terrible singer in general, but she didn't have the training for something like that.

Stop singing! Moody ordered. Hermione followed that command gladly.

Somewhere in her haze, she thought she heard another voice—Harry's voice—saying, "Tell her to…" but she couldn't make out the rest.

But Moody must have taken Harry's advice because he commanded, Write "two plus two equals five" on the blackboard.

No way! Hermione's inner self didn't even hesitate to react.

Do it. Write "two plus two equals five" on the blackboard. Do it now!

Hermione approached the blackboard and picked up the chalk, but still, she was thinking. I'm not doing it. Don't mess with my maths.

Write it! Write "two plus two equals five"!

Hermione put the chalk to the board and wrote a number 2, a plus sign, another 2, and an equal sign, fighting herself all the while.

Finish it! Moody ordered. Write a five!

Hermione's hand started shaking. She pressed the chalk hard against the board, fighting to control which way her hand would move.

Write a five! NOW!

I do not screw up maths problems!

Suddenly, her hand jerked, and her fingernails raked across the blackboard with a piercing screech. The curse's hold vanished so fast it set her reeling. But when she got her bearings looked up again, she grinned.

There, on the blackboard, was a number 4.

Professor Moody started laughing. "You were right, Potter," he said. "Tell her to act like an idiot, and she'll do it, but tell her to get a maths problem wrong, and she'll fight it off like anything. Ha! Five points to Gryffindor for that one. Granger, you've got some toughness in you. Learn to use it on everything else like you do on maths, and you might be able to fight the Imperius Curse from a real dark wizard.

"Thank you, Professor Moody," she said. She decided to quit while she was ahead, and she and Harry left the room.

The excitement of last night had died down in the Gryffindor Common Room, but people still smiled when Harry came in—except that Ron and Ginny sighed, though for different reasons.

"Hey, Harry, it's almost supper time. What were you doing?" Ron demanded.

"Oh, Hermione wanted Professor Moody to train her in fighting the Imperius Curse. She wanted me to come along."

"Ooh, you went for the Imperius Curse?" Lavender Brown said. "Did he make you do anything really horrible?"

"Not that horrible," she replied. "Except he tried to make me get a maths problem wrong."

Everyone who knew Hermione well gasped.

Harry chuckled: "I know. She fought it off when Moody tried that. I gave him the idea."</pre>

<pre>"A wizard is trying to cross a river," the door knocker said. "He has a fox, a rabbit, and a cabbage. He can only carry one of them across the river at a time, but the fox cannot be left alone with the rabbit, and the rabbit cannot be left alone with the cabbage. In what order must the wizard carry them across—"

"What?" Ginny interrupted. "What are you talking about? Just put a Freezing Charm on the fox and the rabbit, and conjure a bigger boat."

"An acceptable alternative," the knocker said, and it opened the door into Ravenclaw Tower.

"Ugh, stupid riddles," Ginny muttered.</pre>

<pre>This was a little trickier to test than her other spells, since she couldn't replicate the exact conditions of her hair with the wigs, but once she got the spell to the point where nothing bad happened when she tried it on them, she cut off a small lock of her own hair to test it on. After a couple more attempts, it seemed to work on that, and she was ready to try it on herself.

Dry hair was a major cause of frizz, so she applied the spell right after a shower to try to lock in a healthy level of moisture, first lightly towelling her hair, then brushing it, then waving her wand with the words, "Aplana Tejascabello."

That didn't appear to do much while her hair was still damp, but once it fully dried, it did seem to have a softer, smoother wave than usual. This was the moment of truth. She waved her wand again and cast, "Micronima Isiazolio."

"YES!"

"Hermione? What happened?" Lavender called.

Hermione stepped out of the bathroom, and Lavender's and Parvati's jaws dropped.

"I finally got my new spell working."

"Sweet Merlin! Who are you and what have you done with Hermione?" Parvati said. "The real Hermione never tries to fix her hair."

Hermione giggled and flipped her hair, revelling in how much more manageable it was. "I just thought it was time for a change," she said.

"Wow, that really looks nice, Hermione. I'm impressed," Lavender agreed. "Will you let us do your makeup, now?"

"Let's not get carried away."

Her roommates laughed, but she was still off to a great start. But the real test was when she went down to breakfast, and she succeeded in turning a few heads there. Mostly for the novelty, but still. Naturally, the boys were mostly interested in the Quidditch match.

"Ahem. Morning," she said as she reached her friends at the table.

Ron, Ginny, and Harry all did a double take when they saw her.

"Hermione? Is that you?" Ron blurted.

"In the flesh," she said.

"But…but your hair, it's—"

"Straight?"

"Well, yeah."

"Not to mention smooth and shiny," Ginny added. "How did you do it?"

"Magic," she said.

"Magic?"

"All my own spells and not an ounce of product," Hermione said smugly. "Take that, genetics."

"Wow…uh, it looks good," Ron said.

"Why thank you, Ron," she said primly. She smiled as she sat beside him. "Harry, are you ready for the match?"

"Yeah, I'm ready."

"I hope so. I don't think Cho is going to make it easy for you."

Harry turned slightly pink, but he said, "I can handle it."

When the game began, Cho used the same strategy on Harry that she had used on Cedric, marking him closely and following until he spotted the Snitch, and then zooming ahead of him. That was a risky play considering Harry was on a much faster broom than Cedric, but it nearly worked because Harry wasn't keen to play too aggressively against her. Wood put a stop to that, though: "QUIT BEING SUCH A GENTLEMAN! KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!"

Unfortunately, Harry took that a bit too literally and went too far the other way. He spotted the Snitch again and zoomed after it, and Cho did the only thing she could against such a fast broom: she tried to cut him off again. And then Harry did the only thing he could do to get the Snitch: he flew right into her…knocking her off her broom.

Hermione screamed, as did a lot of other people, but Harry apparently knew what he was doing, and he was on a very fast broom. In one fluid motion, he grabbed the Snitch out of the air, flipped over, and dove fast, snatching Cho by the hand and slowing to a stop just off the ground.

The screams in the stands turned to cheers, both for Harry winning the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor and for that stunning bit of flying. Both Harry and Cho were still staring at each other, blushing slightly, when the fans stormed the pitch.

"Uh, thanks, Harry…I think," Cho said.

"No problem," he replied.

"Harry Potter!" Hermione yelled when she reached him. "You could've killed her doing that!" she scolded. "Did you plan that move to catch her from the start?"

"Er, not exactly, but I could tell it was the only thing that would work against her," he said.

"Oh, Harry," she groaned.</pre>

<pre>"But what about the match?" said Harry anxiously. "Did we get a replay?"

No one said anything. They all looked very grim-faced.

"What? We didn't…lose?" Harry said in horror.

"It was a very near thing, Harry," Hermione told him. "If it had been Cedric Diggory or Cho Chang out there, they probably would've got the Snitch before anyone called off the game. But Malfoy…" She looked back over her shoulder. Harry saw the Slytherin Team clustered at the far end of the infirmary. Several of them were glaring at the Gryffindors. "He flew off the Pitch when he saw the dementors. That bought some time."

"Time for what?" Harry said, confused.

"Well, you know how the rules say a match can only be called off if both captains agree?"

"Oh, no…" Harry said, knowing the Slytherins would want to play on. Suddenly, he heard a grunt to his side. Turning, he saw Oliver Wood in the bed next to his, looking bruised and battered.

"Flint took some convincing," Wood groaned.

"Yeah, it was ugly," George added.

"Flint, call for a rematch!" Wood yelled.

"Fat chance, Wood!" Flint yelled back. "We're gonna keep playing."

"Your Seeker flew away!"

"At least he's still conscious. Yours couldn't even stay on his broom when a few dark spirits showed up, the idiot."

At that point, Wood slugged Flint in the face, knocking him into the mud and pummelling him as hard as he could. "You son of a bitch!" He yelled. "Harry almost died because of those things! Call it off! Call it off!"

A moment later, Flint got his hand on his wand, and spells were flying. It was downright scary, seeing two seventh-years go at it no-holds-barred. Dumbledore had already taken Harry up to the castle, and it took the other teachers a bit of time to stop them.

"Flint eventually had to call it off because his knees had been hexed back to front," Fred finished.

"And because fighting a duel in the middle of a game is worth so many fouls that Madam Hooch lost count," George added.

"If the no-wands rule were applied strictly, it would be seventeen penalty shots for Slytherin and twelve for Gryffindor," Hermione said calmly, "although Wood pounding Flint's face into the ground was arguably worth more than one."

"And this is why she's the Quidditch guru," Fred responded with a chuckle. "Hermione Granger never loses count."</pre>

<pre>Yes Mr Malfoy. Draco whirled and saw the other marauders looking around in shock as well. They could hear it too. I must thank you for telling me what you did. Telling me what you did about... a ha... 'Harry Potter'... Ha ha ha...

Draco could see the other marauders staring at him. Of course they knew.

"It was the only way." Draco said straight out. He could see one or two of them nodding. They understood. The ministry wizards were looking confused. Draco hoped they could weather the shock.

You see Draco told me something very interesting. The voice of Voldemort continued in their heads. He told me that Harry Potter, the chosen one, had a life that was both horrible, eventful and crucially short. You see, when he was left with his stinking muggle relatives and, predictably, they were fools. The boy was injured in an accident. Yes good wizards,you did not hear this in the daily prophet. The boy was injured... mortally. And the boy potter... the boy died. The boy Potter died, not by my hand, not by magic, but by chance.

The wizards were shaking their heads. McGonnagal had her hand to her mouth, her eyes wide. Had she suspected? Had she been close enough to Dumbledore to guess? Even if she had she wouldn't have believed it.

But Dumbledore knew that wizardom is blind and foolish. He knew that they would need a symbol. A pointless symbol. They would need their hero. So he made them a straw man, a hero from dirt. He took a filthy muggleborn and made him look like the hero. He gave them a fake. A fake so good even the fake himself didn't know the truth. Not until the old fool told him. Any yes... I see you shaking your heads. I see you wishing it were not true, but it is. Why don't you ask young Draco...

"Is this true Draco?"

Draco turned to his former teacher.

"Yes." The huddle of wizards were struck silent. A picture of wide-eyed shock.

"And you knew?"

"Yes."

"All of you?"

"Yes."

+

Last chance The voice of the dark lord said quietly in his mind. Draco just shook his head. Do you really expect your hero to arrive?

"Yes." Pythea answered him out loud. "Yes I do. And he will destroy you."

A nameless, muggleborn boy who pretends to be a hero is coming? The dark lord laughed. Do you expect me to be scared?

Pythea did the most unexpected thing then. She laughed.

"You really have no idea do you?" The seer shook her head. "He was never meant to live. Born without a name, cast into a raging torrent he survived by chance. He wasn't meant to, he was meant to die but destiny has no hold on him. Before he could walk he had already broken free of fate. That would have been the end of it but then he was taken and thrust into the middle of a dead prophecy. He lost the only past he had, he took another and with that life he took control again. He took himself from a terrible home and once again chose his own destiny. He chooses his own destiny. And then, still not even an adult, he burnt in the middle of a phoenix fire. He survived the fires of rebirth, it didn't phase him, he had already died twice. And then he not only survived the torrent of ages, he not only survived he actually took control of the torrent. He took control of time and bent a paradox out of his own existence. He still bears the scars today, the paradox scars, on his chest. A living brand of the impossible. He is immune to destiny and he defeated time. And I admit, I was foolish, I thought that was the extent of it. I thought that was as extraordinary as it got. But it is so much more. We saw the fates... we went to see the fates and I saw something extraordinary. We walked into the great cavern... a cavern more massive than the world itself and they came to us. The three fates came to us, they came to us to speak and I almost died of shock. He could not see them! Harry Potter could not even see the fates of Time and Destiny, only the fate of death. They could not touch him, one put it's claw directly through his chest, he did not even flinch. He left thinking only one was there, I could not tell him, I didn't even understand it myself. But now I do. The three mysteries of the universe, the defining forces of existence, he has put himself beyond them. He beat time with his will, he beat destiny through suffering so no, I do not believe I am foolish in believing he can defeat death. The prophecies of the department of mysteries burn and turn black in his hands. A man with the power to destroy fate has made it his life's work to destroy you." Pythea's eyes flickered up. "So yes Tom Riddle. If I were you, I'd be scared."

+

"So. Enough of that." McGonnagall stepped back and adjusted her bun, her normal expression of sternness on her face. "Will you take the job or not?"

"I... yes!" Draco blurted. "Yes I'll take the job."

"Wonderful. I will expect a brief curriculum by the end of the week, I'll arrange to have the owl and newt syllabi given to you tomorrow." Mcgonnagall turned away and began striding towards the great hall. Draco followed her. "You will not be joining an entirely unfamiliar staff. I have hired The Pythea to teach divination."

"What about Professor Trewalny?"

"She was killed." The response was brief, but filled with strained emotion.

"I didn't even know."

"Only her family and friends were at the funeral." McGonnagall said quickly. "I considered dropping the subject entirely but my deputy headmaster informed me that having an easy subject increases our overall average scores."

"So you made Snape your Deputy Head?"

"He has earned it."

"Right."</pre>

A few hands went up around the class, including Harry's. Neville gulped and tried to hold his hand as low as possible, but Padma took it and jerked it up.

"You there!" Markus pointed to Neville. Padma giggled. "What have you used?"

"Full Body Bind sir." Neville appeared to be wishing he had a hole to crawl into.

"Good! Good solid spell! Incantation, for those who don't know is Petrificus Totalus. And who did you use it on?"

"McGonagall."

"Mc…McGonagall?" A nervous titter of laughter ran around the classroom. "Right, OK. Um… Anyone else?" He pointed at Harry, "How bout you pipsqueak?"

"Acerbus cuspis."

"The pain-spear spell." The teacher stopped moving and turned back towards Harry. "A curse originating in the time of the inquisition, considered by many to be Dark Magic?"

"Er…"

"And who did you use it on?"

"Quirrell."

"Right OK." Michelson shook his head. "Before we dredge up any more assaults against Hogwarts teachers lets start on something else. Who here knows what a shield charm is?" Many of the hands went down (though not of course, Hermione's) "Right! we'll start there."</pre>

Harry internally groaned and rubbed his forehead. He didn't know if it was himself or Tom who thought up that brilliant idea, but it was disturbing to say the least. 'Professor Frankenstein', as the thing was called, was quite gruesome to see, which is probably why Harry hadn't seen him before now. It would be impossible to try and eat with that thing in the great hall.</pre>

<pre>In a strange way, he was closer to Daphne even than to Hermione. Hermione was his best friend, but Daphne had so desperately wanted a big brother, someone to talk to, to protect her, to be her best friend, and everything else except a lover, and Harry honestly couldn’t find a single reason not to be that person for her.

It was weird, slightly, as Daphne would often come and talk to him late at night, sitting on his bed, wearing only the uniform that all girls seemed to sleep in, and not once was he tempted to try and kiss her.

He supposed it meant that Daphne really wasn’t his type, and that it was possible to have a female platonic friend like that.

He’d had to spend a few seconds looking at the French Champion’s bum, just to reassure himself that he was still straight.

And he was.</pre>

“Cully,” he called.

A House-elf appeared in front of him. The House-elf stood up straight. “Professor Dumbledore?”

“There appears to be a problem with the food,” Dumbledore said genially.

Cully looked around. “Cully is not seeing problems,” the House-elf replied.

“There appears to be gruel for breakfast, rather than the wonderful spread you usually provide.”

Cully nodded in agreement. “Yes, gruel,” he agreed. “What is being the problems?”

Dumbledore paused. “Why are we being served gruel?”

Cully smiled happily. “Because you is bullies, and some of you is stinky,” he explained eagerly. “And bullies get gruel.” The House-elf nodded firmly. “Also, House-elves are fed up of dealing with students who don’t bathe. Students who don’t bathe can be doing their own laundries!”

Dumbledore blinked. “I’m sorry, Cully, but I am going to have to order you to make a proper breakfast.”

“Cully thinks that Dumbledore can take his orders and be shoving thems into a small, smelly place where things have been shoved before.”

Romilda almost choked on the egg she’d just taken a bite of.

“Cully, you are demoted. Sharder?”

Another House-elf appeared. “You’s calling Sharder?”

“Sharder, I’m afraid that Cully is no longer head House-elf.”

“Sharder is thinking that Dumbledore is being barmy,” Sharder said. “Barmy peoples not giving Sharder orders.” The House-elf nodded, and popped out.</pre>

<pre>"Professor Lupin? Oh I already know his secret," said Harry confidently. "I'm surprised nobody else has said anything."

"You worked it out too?" asked Hermione, sounding quite impressed.

"Yeah, ages ago," said Harry. "At first I thought he was a drunk, but I figured it out later when I realised he didn't stink enough. Mind you, I used to see them all the time down the street near the shops, so I suppose I had a bit of an advantage."

"You used to see them, out in the open and recognise them?" asked Hermione.

"Yeah, they were always walking up and down the street down there. It was a pretty bad area, scum everywhere."

"Harry!" said Hermione sternly. "That's no way to talk about those unfortunately people. It's not their fault they are like this."

"True, I suppose," said Harry with a shrug. "At least she looks like a man. Some of the ones I saw looked nothing like a woman, despite their dresses and make up. Not even Vernon was fooled, although I think Dudley probably was. I wonder how she's grown the moustache? Magic I suppose."

Hermione's brow creased in puzzlement as she tried to process Harry's comments.

"Harry," she said hesitantly. "What exactly do you think Professor Lupin is?"

"I can't remember the name of them, transvestitutes or something? You know, the people that like to dress and act like a member of the opposite sex. There was even a bit about them in the stupid 'Your body and you' book we all got at the beginning of the year.

"Transvestite? You think Professor Lupin is a Transvestite? Why?" asked Hermione, trying unsuccessfully to hide her grin.

"Well, he always gets sort of grumpy and short tempered, and then goes missing for a few days every month. I read in that book that some women have a really bad time with their – you know," Harry explained, starting off a bit defensively but fading off in embarrassment.

Hermione blushed and cleared her throat.

"Yes, well, er, no Harry, Professor Lupin is not a woman dressing up as a man. He is a werewolf."

"Oh," said Harry, not sure whether he should feel embarrassed, relieved, or worried.

In the end, he decided it was all too much trouble to feel any of those and so just figured he would ignore it, except -

"You, er, you won't tell anybody what I thought, will you?" asked Harry.

Hermione's feral grin was not reassuring</pre>

<pre>"-and I remembered seeing a football match on the television a while back at my uncle's house. The crowd did this amazing thing called a 'Mexican Wave', ever heard of it?"

Both girls nodded.

"That's the thing where everybody takes turns standing up, right?"

"Yeah. I thought it looked pretty cool, although Dudders and Vern-pig trying it on the couch was funnier, especially when the poor thing busted apart under them. Well I was thinking it would be really neat to get everybody here to do that."

"That would be pretty hard, wouldn't it?" asked Han. "I mean, how will you get the Slytherins to join in?"

"Is that who we are playing?" said Harry, ignoring the pair's exasperated look and turning to face the stands. "Anyway, I thought so too, but then I remembered that I am a wizard."

He suddenly brought his wand up and twirled it around in a flashy looking pattern before pointing it directly at a portion of the crowd in the stands.

Across from him, directly in front of his wand, the crowd suddenly leapt to their feet. As he quickly swept his wand along, the crowd obediently, and apparently involuntarily, jumped up in a rolling wave. Harry spun right the way around until he was back where he started, and then lowered his wand.

He turned to face the two awestruck girls.

"Pretty good, eh?" he asked, grinning. "You reckon Flower's will count that as contributing?"

"That was amazing," said Sue. "How in the world did you do it?"

"Stinging hex runes on the seats," answered Harry. "Probably never work again, though."

"You drew a Rune on every seat?" asked Han.

"Of course not," answered Harry, turning back to watch the amusing sight of the confused crowd trying to figure out what happened. "I got B1 and B2, those red-headed maniac Gryffs to do it for me.</pre>

<pre>Releasing Lucius from the pain curse after a few moments, Voldemort closed his eyes as the room rapidly cleared. "Fools," he thought. "I'm beginning to think I should have started a Mudblood revolt; or a Half-blood one anyway. Perhaps these Purebloods actually are too inbred to be of any use to me. Ah well, this is their last chance. If they fuck up again, they're gone. I'll just wait a few decades, and then try to find some competent followers. I don't give a shit about the politics, anyway. It's all about the power."</pre>

<pre>The long first day of school finally ended with nothing more exciting happening than Harry unexpectedly earning his house five points thanks to his video game knowledge. Then he had a satisfying dinner and went back to the common room, where Ron invited him to play a game of chess. Hermione was hovering nearby with her nose buried in a book as usual, occasionally telling him to 'work on his pawn structure' or 'take control of the center'. Harry didn't eve know what her advice meant half of the time, and, predictably, was losing badly.

It was frustrating. He knew that Ron was the better player by far, but the bloke didn't have to be so smug about it. Harry would have loved to win even once, ending his mate's 97-0 streak and hopefully bringing him down a notch, but none of the strategies he had tried were good enough. Well, there was this one thing he could try, but it would make him look like a fool if it didn't work, and possibly anger Ron on the off-chance that it did.

"You might as well give up at this point, Harry." Ron grinned at him in a self-satisfied manner. "Then we can start another match so I can rack up a hundred victories faster."

That's it... Weasley was going down! Harry slammed his hands on the table and started speaking, feeling more than a little self-conscious. "Listen up, men! We've suffered many casualties, but the battle is not yet lost. Our enemies are commanded by a soulless ginger who leads with ruthlessness and brutality. What do they know about courage? What do they know about honor?"

"Oi!" protested Ron.

Harry continued his impassioned speech, gazing upon his rapt subjects. "Hear me, valiant pawns, noble knights, devoted bishops! Hear me, mighty rooks, graceful queen, shrewd king! Win this battle, and you will live a life of luxury, not wanting for anything! Bards will sing of your heroic deeds, and your glory will be known throughout the lands!"

"Can we have dirty magazines?" piped up one of the bishops. "It gets awfully boring inside that case."

"Absolutely! Dirty magazines for everyone!" declared Harry immediately.

There was a silence for a few moments, then cheers from all Harry's remaining pieces shook the board. Some Gryffindors even wandered over to see what the commotion was, joining Hermione in watching the game.

"This is stupid," scoffed Ron. "They don't actually have brains, you know. G4 to F3."

Harry frowned at the pawn about to take his knight, and spoke quickly. "Honorable knight, your title was bestowed upon you by the queen herself. Are you going to let a mere foot soldier defeat you? Stand your ground, and crush the upstart pawn! Then, and only then will you be allowed to rest your sword!"

Ron's pawn raised his pike, but the knight was faster. He decapitated the enemy piece with a deft strike of his weapon, then bowed deeply to Harry and walked off the board. The pawn felt about for his detached head, picked it up, and followed suit.

"Hey! That's cheating!" Ron shouted, incensed.

"All I did was speak to him. We can stop if you want to."

"No way." Ron grinned suddenly, completely changing his demeanor. "This might actually give me a challenge. Pawn to C4."

"Brave soldier, the enemy is right in front of you. Break through and line up with your comrades! Do that, and the king will grant you a title and land!"

The pawn Harry commanded so raised his spear and stabbed straight at the opposing piece in front of him. Then it moved forward, not one, but two tiles, forming a line with his compatriots. Harry cheered, and so did a few spectators, who apparently found the current game between Harry and Ron more exciting than the one-sided rout it normally was.

"Now that's just unfair," commented Ron, fully focused on the game field. "Let's see... Knight to E5."

Harry surveyed the situation; it was clear that the black pieces still held an overwhelming advantage. Unless he was mistaken, Ron would use the knight he had just moved to check Harry's king the next turn, and Harry had no knights of his own left. Furthermore, all his pawns were situated on the left side, leaving his right one exposed.

There was nothing else to do, but to try and break down the rules of the game entirely.

"Soldiers, you have fought tirelessly, and I thank you for your service. But before you can lay your weapons down, we need one last push. Raise your shields, point your spears, and march towards the enemy king!" He then turned towards his rooks and the remaining bishop. "Support the infantry and don't let their sacrifice go to waste!"

For one tense moment, none of the pieces moved. Then the king turned his tiny head and spoke to Harry in a squeaky voice.

"Isn't this against the rules, General?"

"Do you want to win or not?"

The king turned back to his army. "You heard him, men! Charge!"

The pawns moved as one, forming a tiny phalanx and marching forward. They barely slowed down their charge when a knight and then a bishop fell to their pikes. Rooks followed, while the bishop protected their right flank.

"You can't do that!" sputtered Ron, staring at the chaos on the board with wide eyes. "Bishop, take the pawn at C5... What the hell, he moved past! Um, king to G8, castle..."

Harry's deadly pawn formation slammed into Ron's defenders, making short work of the more powerful pieces. He lost a few in the charge, but it didn't matter; the remaining white army surrounded the king, who capitulated by raising his arms and removing his crown. And so, amid cheers from his fellow housemates, Harry won his first chess match against Ron.

"I don't know what the bloody hell that was, but it wasn't chess," grumbled Ron. "I would have won otherwise."

"Oh, I suppose," Harry said agreeably. "Board games were never my forte." He repaired the damaged pieces with the Mending Charm and swept them into the case, ignoring their excited chattering.

Hermione stared at him in horror. "What about all those things you promised them?"

Harry shrugged. "They're just chess pieces, Hermione."

"You manipulated them!"

He grinned. "That was pretty interesting, wasn't it? I didn't think they would listen to me like that."

"But you promised them riches, and titles, and, um, reading material, and now you're just locking them away..."

"Don't worry, Hermione, they don't even work until you remove them from the case, and they don't remember anything about the previous games." Ron explained, coming to his friend's defense. "They're not really intelligent; it's just some clever magic which temporarily borrows a bit of your personality."

"Fascinating," murmured Hermione, her latest crusade forgotten now that she had this incredible magic to think about.

Meanwhile, Harry raised his chess board towards the people gathered around their table. "Anyone else fancy a game?"</pre>

<pre>"Which brings me neatly onto the next little surprise these two lovebirds had for me," Sirius noted. "It appears that our best-buddy Voldemort loved Harry and Ginny so much he showered them with gifts. Now, most of you know that Ginny has his memories as a result of her run-in with his diary…"

"What?" Percy squealed. "His memories? What are you talking about?"

"Nice girly shriek, Percy, very macho," Ginny laughed. "I've told you I was possessed by Voldemort acting through an old diary of his, right? He was trying to suck out my life-force to enable him to return, remember? Well, when the diary was destroyed, all the life-force that Voldemort had stolen came rushing back into me. But that's not all. Because we were connected so closely when he was destroyed, all of his memories up to the point that he made the diary ended up in me, as well. I can remember everything that Voldemort did up to the age of sixteen."

"Bugger me," Audrey gasped.

"Sorry, that's Percy's job," Ginny smirked. "Before anyone asks, no, it does not make me the next Dark Lord in waiting. I'm still the same person I always was, I just have a bit more knowledge then I had before."

"Like knowing how the Horcruxes were created," Hermione added helpfully.

"Exactly," Ginny agreed, smiling at her friend. "Unfortunately, the memories only go up to the point Riddle created his first Horcrux: the diary. That's why I can't be sure exactly how many he made or what they are. I know pretty much everything about his earlier years, however."

"What colour underwear did he wear?" Luna asked.

"Why could you possibly want to know that?" Tonks asked in bewilderment.

"You can tell a lot about people by their underwear choices," Luna explained, "that's why I don't wear any. It maintains a sense of mystery about me."

"Bet it makes you popular with the boys, too," Tonks muttered.</pre>

<pre>"Great, sounds like another year with a cracking Defence teacher," Harry moaned, "just what we need. Honestly, I could do better than most of the teachers we've had, Remus excluded."

"Oh, Professor Potter; I like the sound of that," Ginny giggled. "Please, sir! I've been a bad girl and need to be punished. Will you give me detention?"

"Focus, please!" Sirius said loudly. "Can we get through this meeting first? You and Harry can go and play naughty schoolgirls later, Ginny."

"Sounds like fun," Harry whispered into Ginny's ear. She just smirked at him.

+

"Well, that leaves me plenty of room for manoeuvre," Ginny muttered before taking a seat next to Harry. "Hi, Luna; how was the rest of your holiday?"

"Very nice, thank you, Ginny," Luna replied with a smile. "After Harry's birthday party, Father and I visited Mali in search of the Greater-Horned Jarwobbler."

"Did you find one?" Hermione asked with exaggerated patience.

"No, but it's not really surprising," Luna admitted.

"Why was it not surprising?" Hermione asked with the expression of someone who knows they are walking into a trap but just can't help themselves.

"Because the Greater-Horned Jarwobbler is found in Madagascar," Luna replied calmly.

There was silence for about ten seconds before Hermione's logic-powered brain forced the question through the girl's lips.

"So, if you were looking for a Greater-Horned Jarwobbler, and you know they live in Madagascar, why didn't you go to Madagascar?" she asked in a strangled voice.

"Because the Portkey we had went to Mali," Luna explained.

"See, there's a logical explanation for everything, Hermione," Harry chuckled.

Ginny did her best to stifle her own giggles while wondering when Hermione had developed that nervous tic.</pre>

"For a long time I stayed in my rat form posing as the pet of a Wizarding family called the Weasleys. It gave me a chance to keep tabs on what was happening and await any sign of my master returning…"

"Scabbers?" Percy interrupted in horror.

"Oh, look, its little Percy," Pettigrew grinned. "Still masturbating using those dirty magazines when everybody thinks you're studying?"

<pre>His required time supervising the children was over. It was his habit of long standing to celebrate the end of his shift by having a drink at the three Broomsticks. This, however, was made unbearable by the women who suddenly found him desirable. School girls, one as young as 4th year, so many 7th years even the bulk of his female Slytherins, adult witches, two different wizards and even Rosmerta herself had come to him offering their bodies, some coyly, others outright.

Had he believed even for a moment that it was him they were attracted to he might have been tempted, even though he hadn't truly been attracted to any woman since Lily Evans. But that wasn't what was happening. His damnable luck was pulling them to him. And his ego could not allow that.

Escaping the bar, he made his way to the pickup point for the carriages to Hogwarts. There he spotted several of his pursuers.

He hesitated for a moment. He could have depended upon his professorial status to keep them at bay, but decided that he didn't need the aggravation, and set out for the walk to the castle.

Severus' left foot struck something in the snow, causing him to fall forward. He picked himself up with a curse and looked to see what had tripped him. He dusted the snow from the obstacle and found a bag of galleons.

Again? This was the fourth one today.

It was just too much for Severus to take any longer. He looked to the sky and screamed; "WHO KEEPS LOSING THESE BLOODY MONEY BAGS?"

oooOOOooo

"I don't know, Potions Professor Fella," responded a voice, breaking into his solitude. "You find more than one?"

Severus spun to face the speaker before he recognized the voice. Of course, he mused, who else would it be? The boy hung upside down from one of his trademark vines, sill barefoot and clad in his loincloth of holding. The child's one surrender to the weather was a woolen scarf around his neck and a pair of ear muffs.

"I have found several," Severus answered. "Should you be this far from the castle as a first year?"

"Part of deal with Headmaster is free run of the forest for Little Guy," the boy explained. "Potions Professor Fella is unhappy? Why? You get to make potions all the time!"

More and more Severus was having problems hating the boy. He was, Severus finally admitted to himself, nothing like James Potter. "Potions have lost their… allure as of late, since an accident I had with the Felix Felicis you brewed for the demonstration."

"The Bahati potion? What happen…? Oh," the boy say his eyes widening with realization. "Your hair, your skin, you are luck now?"

His mouth firmly set in a line, Severus nodded. Not one of his fellow staff had made that connection, not even Albus. Someday, he was going to have to meet the jungle man who raised the boy. "My body appears to be producing it now."

"Ah," the boy joined his nod while dismounting his vine with a summersault. "I like potions 'cause they fun, you love potions 'cause they hard. With luck, you lose challenge."

"You understand then," Severus noted as the pair began walking toward the castle.

"Yes," Little Guy agreed. "Is same for me with being here. Is fun, but I miss challenge of home where I needed."

"You are needed?" Severus asked.

"Mbebwe is big jungle," the boy admitted. "Even Dad can't be everywhere. I helped where Dad was not."</pre>

<pre>“Lord Potter, if you’d come with me… I have a task for you.”

“Of course,” Harry said and stood. He followed her out of the common room with small glance in Hermione’s direction. “Is something wrong?”

“Just a bunch of horrified first years,” Minerva said. “All of the Hufflepuffs were trying to sleep in their common room—they’d gone so far as to develop a schedule so they could sleep in shifts. The Ravenclaws were trying to learn the Patronus Charm, now two of them are magically exhausted and the Slytherins all ended up in the boy’s dorm where they set up a blanket fort and an intent ward.”

“Well… at least this situation inspired team work,” Harry said dryly.

+

“As to your threat to burn her at the stake, you’d take care to remember what happened to London in 1666. Magic learned to protect her own, and when a group of young men tried to set fire to a pretty witch who wouldn’t give them the time of day—they set the entire city ablaze and she walked through that fire and returned to us unharmed.”

+

“Well, Lord Potter did ban him and Dementors from the school,” Snape said bluntly. “And Lord Black has plans to ruin him—though his method is a mystery.”

“I’m going to run him out of office, bankrupt him, sleep with his new trophy wife, and…” Sirius trailed off when Harry poked him. “Okay, maybe not the wife. She’s not all that attractive anyway.”

+

“What is the most dangerous snake Lord Potter has in his life?”

Willaby paused, considered that, and rocked back on his heels. “A coatl.”

“A coatl? There is a coatl in Serpent’s Lair?”

“Oh, no, Lady Potter be sitting over there,” Willaby pointed at Hermione.</pre>

<pre>Things were getting out of hand.

The new history teacher that the board forced him to hire had given his first year classes an essay on recent Dark Lords. Most wrote about Grindelwald, or You-Know-Who, but two students in Ravenclaw, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger both wrote about Dumbledore.

Those essays originally received only marginal grades, but the students challenged the marks. As per the rules for challenging the essays made the rounds of the faculty and were slowly upgraded with each passing professor that read the essay.

When the essays hit the Deputy Head's desk, she not only upgraded the marks to Outstandings, she also awarded points to the two students. That caused a number of Professors to question Minerva who confirmed the timelines and facts laid out in the essays.

While both students wrote about the same man, Hermione took his early years, exposing Dumbledore's involvement with Grindelwald and Harry's essay dealt with the rise of Voldemort and Dumbledore's response to Voldemort. He laid out the formation of the Order of the Phoenix then he labeled it the most ineffective and incompetent militia ever created.

+

She spread her wings and slowly lifted up off the floor. In one hand appeared a 8 foot long flaming blade. "I am the protector of the chosen! Beware lest I smite thee!" she intoned. The room shook with the power of her voice and the portraits all fled their painting in a panic.

Fawkes awoke with a squawk and took in the scene. He honked once and flamed to another room where he honked continuously for nearly an hour. He caused such a ruckus that dozens of other Phoenixes flamed in, wanting to know what was so funny. The result of so many phoenixes flashing into Dumbledore's private quarters was a fire hot enough to glaze the stones of the castle, and destroy most of Albus' private quarters.

+

"Really Santa got me something?"

She smiled, he was such a child sometimes. "Santa brought you a train like the one Harry and Bugger were using."

He thought about that for a moment. "Did Santa remember to bring track too?"

Luna suddenly took a sharp breath. Drat! She had forgotten the track! "Ummmm."

Harry smiled. "No matter, I know where to find track that's just the right size and it won't bother the muggles at all!"

He waved a hand and the room started to fill with shrunk down railroad tracks. "This is going to be fun!" he exclaimed.

Meanwhile, miles away in Gringotts, a cart carrying ten goblins sailed into open space as the track beneath the cart vanished. Goblins plummeting to their deaths sounded remarkably like cats fighting. Gringotts would spend months wondering what happened to ten miles of track.

+

Dumbledore nodded to Ludo who finally realized that he was being told to start. He smiled at the Headmaster and waved to Filch who was ready at the cannon. Filch leaned forward and gripped the lanyard and started to yank on it. Suddenly the cannon pivoted away from the forbidden forest pulling the cord in his hand taut. Filch's motion plus the movement of the cannon was enough to cause it to fire.

Harry chuckled and stuck his wand back in it's holster as the cannon fired. Two second later Hagrid's hut exploded.

"Nice shooting Davy Crockett," commented Harry. Filch looked at him, then at the cannon, then at an extremely angry Hagrid clawing his way out of the wreckage and promising death to whoever blew up his house. Filch immediately did the mature thing, he fainted.

Up in the stands, Luna, Hermione and Bugger held up cards reading, "8.6", "8.8" and "6.6". Harry grinned and woke up Filch with a quick enervate. "You got good scores from everyone except for that Canadian judge, Argus. You just might win this!" He said, clapping the man on the back and helping him up. "But I think its time to run before Hagrid gets here. Better get into the maze quick!"

Filch blinked at Harry in confusion, then he shrieked as Hagrid continued to close the distance. The half giant had an axe in his hand and he clearly wanted blood! Filch pivoted and immediately ran into the maze with Hagrid hot on his heels.

"Hey! No fair!" Harry called out loud. "They aren't in the competition! If this open to anyone then I refuse to participate. This task is for champions only!"

The three judges and the three contestants stared at each other in confusion wondering what to do next. Meanwhile the fire that had been burning in Hagrid's fireplace was spreading and the wreckage started to smolder.

From somewhere in the maze Filch screamed as he ran across one of the obstacles that took offense to his presence. Not being capable of using magic, it was quite likely that Argus Filch had just become lunch for one of Hagrid's misunderstood beasties.

Harry shook his head and stomped up to the other champions. "Look I don't want to be out here all day! It looks like it's going to rain! Get in there or those other two will beat you to the center! Mush! Pronto! Shake a leg!"

All three champions stared at Harry for a moment and then he reached for his wand. They ran, climbing and clawing at each other to get out Harry's way. In a moment they rounded the bend and they were gone.

Harry looked up at the stands to see everyone, even the Delacour family laughing. Thinking he was on a roll, Harry decided to try one more thing. He turned and dashed over to the Judges. "Hurry!" he exclaimed, "If you don't watch them you'll never be able to judge them properly!"

Eurkov, Dumbledore and Maxime blinked in shock and then chased after the contestants.

In front of the stands, the huge screen displaying the interior of the maze split again to cover the three judges, three contestants, one dead squib and a bewildered half giant. Harry smirked, it was obvious how they intended to judge the champions. "Morons," Harry muttered to himself, then he eyed his next target.

Harry turned to Ludo and tapped the mic hard a couple times. "This thing on?" he asked.

Ludo nodded dumbly at him, clearly shocked by this turn of events. "Good, because I've just proved once and for all time that the judges are idiots and probably should be fired. Clearly this is beyond their abilities," Harry said grandly then he turned away.

Harry walked over to the entrance and pulled a shrunken chair from his pocket and enlarged it. Then he enlarged a fancy footrest and a small table and lamp. Sitting in the chair, an Elf appeared and handed him a drink and his book.

+

Harry trudged out of the maze and looked around. Madam Pomfrey was frantically working on Krum who seemed to be missing both arms.

"So much for a Quidditch Career," Harry said shaking his head.

He glanced over to spot Dumbledore and the other two judges being yelled at by none other than Percy Weasley. This he couldn't miss.

He sidled over to the table where they stood. Ludo Bagman sat at the table staring in shock at Weasley.

"What the hell is wrong with you three? You not only ran into the maze like a bunch of idiots, you nearly killed Krum! Cedric is missing and the Veela chickie is bawling her eyes out from fear."

Harry smiled and pulled out his wand, he used it to push Ludo's microphone closer to the argument.

"What were you thinking? Why did you attack Krum?" demanded Percy.

Madam Maxime looked embarrassed, and she shuffled in place. "He tried to kiss me."

"He ran into a section we had charmed to inflict an intense lust on it's victim," admitted Dumbledore. "It was harmless, really. We honestly were hoping the Veela chick would get caught in it, give her a taste of her own medicine as it were."

"Da, so big Momma here gets a horny Krum and she pulls his arms off in fear," added Eurkov.

Percy blinked and looked at the three of them in disbelief. "And Ms. Delacouer?"

Eurkov grimaced. "Dat wuz my idea. Hogwarts champion has small willy, so we transfigured a walking talking six foot long willy to taunt him. Veela ran into dat."

Percy shook his head and glared at the three. "I'm declaring this contest over and we'll never hold another! Do you know in the past hour we've received hundreds of diplomatic messages laughing at us? You've made us look like idiots!"

"Hey, did you know this microphone is live?" called Harry.

Everyone turned to stare in horror at the microphone.

Harry shrugged. "I'm going home. Send my winnings there," he called over his shoulder.</pre>

<pre>The sorting hat was without doubt one of the most revered magical relics of the Hogwarts' founders. Hermione didn't pay that reverence any mind whatsoever. The hat had hurt her Harry, and only the fact it was on his head at the time stopped Hermione drawing her wand. Instead she swiftly ripped that tattered old hat off her intended and uncaringly cast it aside. To Hermione, Harry's welfare was far more important than any magical headwear.

Harry was swaying on the stool so, in a scene scarily reminiscent of Halloween, she sat on the floor and guided her intended down beside her. Helping Harry's head gently find her lap, Hermione was soon running her fingers through his hair. She was trying to offer him some sort of comfort as Harry's entire body was currently shaking.

"Hermione... I think I preferred wrestling that troll. This was much worse..."

Hermione then found herself being shouted at by an aggrieved sorting hat. "Why did you stop me? Have you any idea what you could have done?"

"You were hurting Harry..." Hermione didn't say any more, she didn't think she needed to say anymore. That was all the justification she would ever need to take action.

The hat was not impressed with her reasoning. "Mister Potter has locked memories. I can't sort him with partial information, I was unlocking those memories..."

"You were hurting him, doesn't that count for anything?"

"I'm the sorting hat, I sort - and sing. It's what I was made to do - and you stopped me..."

"Listen to me, you moth-eaten piece of tattered old cloth. It was only the fact that you were on my Harry's head that stopped me incinerating you. It may have escaped your notice but you're not on my Harry's head anymore."

Realising that this was no idle threat from the enraged girl, McGonagall raced over and lifted the hat from where Hermione had uncaringly tossed it. A still angry Hermione just had to have the last word. "You're singing's shit too..."

Hearing Hermione swear told Harry exactly how angry she was, he comfortingly squeezed her hand. Even though his voice was shaky, the entire great hall heard him clearly. "Hermione, I saw my mum..."

That wasn't just a conversation stopper, the occupants of the hall held their collective breath while anxiously awaiting to hear more. "It was just me and my mum. I was in my cot - then this really ugly bugger broke into my bedroom. Blood-red crazy eyes and no nose... How do you lose your nose? That's just bloody carelessness - that's what that is."</pre>

“Ooh!” Remus winced. “I’ll bet that didn’t go over well.”

“It did not.” Dobby told me the elves at school would refer to her as ‘the Dark Knitter’, and ‘She-Who-Must-Not-Knit’.’</pre>

<pre>Rather than growing angry at him, Michelle surprised Harry by letting out a rueful chuckle and running her hand through her hair. "Touché. I'm sorry. I'm just… do you have any idea how humiliating this whole thing is for me? The only Reaper who gets less respect is Cordelia, and that's because her star client is She-Who-Chokes-to-Death-Slobbering-On-Knobs." Harry blinked owlishly and she clarified. "The redhead you were checking out? Yeah, saw her file on the way in. This is her third straight death by erotic asphyxiation. Turns out having something shoved down your throat for long periods of time gets in the way of breathing properly. Who'da thunk it?"

"And you say I have embarrassing deaths. At least you're not her Reaper."

+

"Well, if you married them all, at least when you died again it might be with a smile on your face?" Michelle waited a few beats to see if Harry cracked a smile, rolling her eyes and continuing when he didn't. "Maybe I can add a sense of humor along with everything else before I send you back. At any rate, I told you that you could have up to five wives. I didn't say you'd get to pick them for yourself. I'm going to. Well, a few of us are going to. I'm teaming up with some other Reapers to find useful women who died before they were supposed to but who - at the same time - aren't critical enough to their world to be given a second go of it. We're going to offer them two choices: move on or be turned into teenage girls and sent to help you. Considering how many people pass through here, I'm sure we'll find you some qualified help in no time."

Harry couldn't help himself, his jaw dropping as he stared at Michelle in disbelief. Mostly because he'd seen some very strange stuff go by while he was out in the waiting room, and even if they picked humans? How was he supposed to explain strange new girls showing up in his life. "…you're going to what?"

Smirking, Michelle nodded in the direction of a stack of folders that were sitting on her desk next to his own, fairly thick file. "We've been compiling candidates since your twenty-eighth death just in case this came to pass. Granted they're not technically the most qualified people in existence - they're here in the Nexus after all - but we think we've found some who will work out well. Actually, we've got more than we need at this point; I'm still trying to narrow down from our twelve semi-finalists to the final five that you'll be marrying."</pre>

<pre>And I bet she has had intercourse quite often since then, too. That actually was not as big a shock as it might be were she part of some other family, now that he thought about it a little more. Sirius Black had been caught trying to peek into the girls' half of the Gryffindor Quidditch team's locker room when he was a second-year, and even if only half of his rumored liaisons actually took place, it would still make him one of the most promiscuous students Filius had ever had. Sadly, he was not far ahead of everyone else; his younger brother Regulus, after all, had been much the same way, though admittedly more discreet. Ironically, the Black whose openness in regard to her nocturnal activities most closely matched Sirius's was actually Bellatrix. Andromeda, while far more demure than her older sister in other matters, had not been too far behind in terms of her number of partners. Then there were those horrible rumors that had bounced around about Narcissa's preferences, though they had been proven unfounded once she was happily betrothed to Lucius Malfoy. And who could forget Nymphadora Tonks, who had had the bad luck to be found in flagrante delicto by Pomona not once but several times per year once she hit fourteen?

"How is the world not drowning in Blacks when they screw around like rabbits?" he muttered to himself.

She shrugged. "We have a disproportionate number of miscarriages and stillbirths. Aunt Andi once told me that she's been pregnant eleven or twelve times, but Dora's the only one who survived to term."</pre>

<pre>Dumbledore conjured clothes for both students and arranged an escort back to the castle (deciding not to leave Ron alone in Luna's company right then). Once the newlyweds, as Luna insisted they be referred to, had departed with Professor Snape of all people (much to Ron's horror), Dumbledore met with the now assembled Order at their impromptu headquarters.

By now, to his dismay, the animated broomsticks had multiplied so much that there were easily a dozen present along every street in the village. The accompanying music was beginning to grate on everyone's nerves, save perhaps the Weasley twins who instead seemed positively delighted by the current state of affairs. Seeing their already demented grins of glee, Dumbledore decided against revealing the fates of their younger siblings.

Dealing with the broomsticks had severely hampered their efforts to finds Harry and Tonks. Most people made the same mistake that Dumbledore had and blasted the broomsticks, thus causing the cursed things to multiply by the dozen. While Hogsmeade's cobblestone streets were looking better than they had since the founding of the village, it was impossible to step outside without getting a mop in the face.

It took nearly three hours and involved rounding up nearly every able witch and wizard in Hogsmeade, but eventually the tide began to turn and the number of brooms began to drop to manageable levels.</pre>

"Fine," I said. "Every day is fine. I wake up, I eat, I drink, I sit on my porch, I get a little closer to death, then I sleep."

Plutarch made a 'tsk' noise into the phone, and sighed. "Maybe you should get a hobby."

"I hate hobbies," I said.

"Maybe you should get a pet," he said.

"I hate pets," I said.

"You should get a pet that annoys most people. It would be a perfect match for you!" he said.

I really had not missed the way that Capitol people could obliviously insult you in regular conversation. "Why, because I also annoy most people?" I asked.

"I know just the thing. I'll send it to you with Katniss's letters," he said, ignoring my question.

"If you send me a pet, I'm gonna have the girl shoot it and the boy cook it," I threatened.

"I don't believe you could," he said.

"You're wrong," I said. But he was right.</pre>

<pre>He had no idea what was about to happen soon.

"Reducto!"

A stream of red light flew over his head and Harry barely managed to get out of the way, when a second one hit the place he just had stood on.

What the-

"Stupefy!" he rolled out of the way and pulled his wand out of his belt.

"Protego."

The blue shield erected itself in front of him, but was soon barraged by various different lights. It's duration lessened with each spell that crashed into it. It gave him the time though, to observe his surroundings, but what he saw nearly made him gape incredulously.

He knew they were bastards, but such an open move? He would have never thought they had the guts to do it. Usually, politicking and silent maneuvering was more their style, but maybe they became restless and finally wanted to show him their superiority?

His mind was racing and he thought about everything he knew of them, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.

Nott was by far the most dangerous of the lot. He was calm and calculating, and showed an unhealthy interest in the dark arts. Sure, they all did, but none were as invested in them as Theodore. From what he had seen during the DaDa lessons, the guy was very good on the offense but had no defensive capabilities to speak of.

Another Reducto hit the ground next to him and chunks of loose earth flew around. Harry adjusted his Protego accordingly. It would probably hold for another minute or two, so he had to think quickly.

Malfoy was absolutely pants at DaDa and barely managed to make a Stupefy work, but in return his wand work in transfiguration was pretty good. Not as good as his own, but formidable nonetheless. It had the potential to be a lethal weapon combined with the charm work of Zabini, who was the balanced one out of the group.

Why were they even attacking him? Wasn't that a bit overt for member of Salazar's house? He grimaced however, when he remembered that the only wards covering the grounds were the ones against apparition. Hagrid hut was too far away and he wouldn't reach it in time either.

His shield had barely any juice left and he stared at the last two of his assailants.

Crabbe and Goyle, two guys from the same chip of block. Barely any brain to speak of, but heavy muscle and a serious problem should they reach him. He doubted that they were able to hit him with any spells, but their violent nature in close combat made them vicious enemies as well.

Maybe, that was the fate's way of telling him that he had to relieve some stress. Yes, the thought was a pleasant one and if it was indeed their will, then he would be happy to oblige. This was a completely different matter than the one in the second task, after all.

These Slytherins attacked him deliberately without cause and did it in a place where help was far away...

A feral grin split his face as his shield gave up under the constant pressure of spell fire. He would make sure not to kill them, of course, but by Merlin it felt good to battle again. He didn't know why it was such a satisfying feeling, but the adrenaline that pumped through his body was welcome in any shape or form.

"Petrificus Totalus!"

Harry simply stepped out of the way and inwardly shook his head. A Petrificus, really? He had expected more from Malfoy.

The Confringo that missed him was another matter altogether. Definitely one of Nott's spells. That could have seriously hurt him if it had hit. Nott was going down!

"Debiles Fulmen!" he shouted, but unfortunately Nott escaped the electrical strike that left his wand. He was about to use another curse, when the sound of someone heavy reminded him that Nott wasn't alone. His wand whipped around and with an overpowered Venti Flamini, Harry threw Crabbe and Goyle away from him.

Not a moment too soon, as he jumped away from another Reducto and flicked his wand to levitate a boulder between him and several incoming curses. The fight was fast paced and he doubted that they would give him the time to use a nice and long incantation...

"Serpensortia!"

Harry couldn't help the mocking look. Malfoy knew he was a parsel tongue, so why did he summon snakes? It became clear however, after Zabini engorged the two snakes and they slithered forwards.

"Surdis!"

What the- Not bad, Harry thought and abandoned his plans to speak with the snakes. Zabini had put a deafening charm on the snakes, preventing any and all communication in parsel tongue.

"Sagitta! Petrae Ictui!"

His aim with the arrow was a bit shoddy and he barely managed to kill the snake to his left before it bit him, but the large stone he threw at the second one had hit it full force. He groaned in annoyance as he saw how Crabbe and Goyle advanced. Again, he blasted them away, but this time he also charmed the ground they crashed onto. The sticky glue they landed in would make it hard for them to attack again.

With the brutes out of the way, he started to duel in earnest with Malfoy, Zabini and Nott. Spells flew through the air, illuminating the dark night and shields snapped into place, preventing most of the injuries. It wasn't easy to parry the spells of all three, but somehow he managed and it was exhilarating!

Sure, he could have transfigured some stone warriors and animated them to do his bidding. That would have ended the whole affair rather fast however, and he wanted to enjoy the thrill of battle for a while longer.

He had just stepped out of the way from an errant Reducto, when a sudden screech reached his ears. A very familiar screech.

No! No, no, no!

Hedwig had seemingly felt that he was in battle and to protect her companion, she made her way over to them. Now, the snowy owl was pecking viciously at Zambini's head.

"No! Hedwig, away! Stay away!" he cried out and surprisingly his familiar obeyed.

Then, it all went to hell.

"Ignem Aestifer!"

A stream of incredibly hot fire spilled out of Nott's wand and hit Hedwig. Harry blanked out. He recognized the spell and knew it to be a fire created from the dark arts. Not on the level of Fiendfyre, but absolutely lethal nonetheless.

For a moment, everything stilled and Harry couldn't belief what just happened. The fire stopped and what remained was a large pile of ash. Ash...

He looked to Nott, who had a cruel glint in his eyes, and his own expression turned into unadulterated and unchained hatred.

"BASTARD!" Harry snarled and his wand was in motion, quicker and with more precision than ever before. "Reducto! Ardere Sagitto! Debiles Fulmen! Petrae Ictui! Percutere! Reducto!"

Dozens of spells went after Nott, who did his best to avoid each of them, fear suddenly painted across his face.

He was relentless. He transfigured rodents and birds, left and right, to attack the miserable bastard and spell after spell left Harry's lips, crashing against the measly defenses of Nott. Malfoy and Zabini were still stunned from the happenings of the last minutes.

Diffindos hit Nott and each of them left a slash wound somewhere on his body. An arrow drilled itself through his shoulder and only when the Slytherin lied before him, broken and bloodied, did Harry stop his assault.

He levitated Crabbe and Goyle, and dumped them on the downed Slytherin. His eyes looked haunted, when he turned to Malfoy and his voice was brittle.

"Take them and leave."

Zabini was quick to comply, but Malfoy was still rooted to the spot, mere feet away from Hedwig's ashes.

"LEAVE!" Harry roared and finally, Malfoy listened and helped Zabini to levitate the three other Slytherins away. Nott needed medical care, but he didn't give a shit.

Hedwig.

He sank to his knees. Hedwig. Tears streamed over his cheeks and fell into her ashes.

A phoenix song reached his ears, but it didn't make him happier. Hedwig. He saw the fiery combustion to his right and Fawkes appeared in a ball of flames. Harry's sorrow turned into blinding anger.

"Where was he?!" he screamed at Fawkes. "Where was the man if he knew what was happening? Answer me, Fawkes!"

The phoenix stared back at him, unblinking, and suddenly thoughts not his own entered his mind. "He doesn't know? But you..."

"You felt my sadness?"

Fawkes bobbed his head, but instead of continuing to sing, he flew over to the ashes and mixed his own tears in them.

What... and then he remembered. It was a passage he had read after his second year in the attempt to understand more about Fawkes.

Born from fire of darkness, bathed in tears of light – the phoenix rises and takes flight.

Back then, he thought it to be metaphorical nonsense, but what if... He turned to Fawkes, disbelief written all over his face and then he saw it.

A small, bald head that poked out of the ashes.

Hedwig.</pre>

<pre>After giving it some thought, Harry simply asked Hedwig if she'd rather fly to Hogwarts on her own. She was out of the cage and winging out of sight in seconds, giving Harry a chuckle. That made for a much quieter ride than might have been for him and Ginny. Charlie somehow managed to end up riding with them as well, sitting between them. Harry was inclined to let it pass, but by the set of her mouth he could tell Ginny was getting annoyed.

"So Da rode with Ron and Hermione?" she asked after a few minutes.

"I think he did," Harry confirmed.

Ginny nodded. "Good thing. Can't leave those two unsupervised."

Charlie coughed. "What?"

"Oh yeah," Ginny said. "There's a pool on when those two will do the deed."

Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from laughing out loud.

"There's what?" Charlie yelled, making the cab driver glance back at them in the mirror.

"You didn't know?" Ginny gasped. "You never noticed how Mum never left those two unsupervised? Not that it will do much good once they're at Hogwarts." Charlie's face turned redder and redder as his baby sister continued. "That reminds me. I wanted to ask you about broom cupboards."

"Broom. Cupboards," Charlie choked out.

"Yes, broom cupboards," Ginny confirmed. "Which ones are the most comfortable? Which ones don't get checked as often? I heard you were quite the lady's man in your day, so I figured you would know."

"You don't need to know about that!" Charlie hissed, and gave Harry a filthy look for good measure.

"What?" Ginny asked, clearly scandalized, "Do you want me to get caught shagging Harry?"

Harry muffled a cough. He had absolutely no desire to draw attention to himself at this point.

"You are not shagging Harry, ever!" Charlie declared.

"And how do you propose to stop me when I'm at Hogwarts and you are in Romania?" Ginny asked sweetly.</pre>

<pre>"Alice, it's gorgeous," I declared, and she smiled broadly at me. I noticed that Edward hadn't followed me in, suspected superstition about viewing the dress, and added in a louder voice that I meant to carry outside, "Edward! Just how likely is it that you're going to avoid seeing what it looks like in Alice's head until - when will it be, Alice?" I inquired.

"Next week," she reported, entirely chipper. "Wednesday. I thought at first you'd ask Carlisle to perform the ceremony, but then you were going to decide that it'd make it look to your parents less like you suddenly eloped. So the official story is that you're bringing only me to witness and getting a court official to handle it, although really of course we're all going. To Ukraine, by the way, because we know your parents know how old you are and it would be easy to look up minimum age laws, but we can tell them Edward's just turned eighteen; his Forks paperwork has an early June birthday on it if anyone looks. I rented a plane so you don't have to be cooped up with humans."

"Who is it who flies?" I asked.

"Edward," Alice told me. "Emmett started, but he ate his instructor and we had to run."

"Such charming family anecdotes we have," I said, grimacing. "Edward, I really am very skeptical that you can avoid learning what this dress looks like until Wednesday! I'll give you a hint! It's white!"

+

I could hear Alice relating the story now, to some inquisitive future addition to the family: "Oh, we're all married. Except Edward and Bella. She ate the justice of the peace, and we had to run."

+

When they reached my rock, he was saying, "Raych, if this is some kind of joke... uh..." He stated at me. It didn't look like he recognized me. His hair was very long. I wondered suddenly if Rachel's fluffy coat was related to her fluffy haircut. If so, Jacob was going to need to visit the barber or he'd look like a cross between a wolf and a mop.

+

"Sue, you aren't just threatening to embarrass me if you bring in the possibility of informing Charlie," I said frantically. "It's not that, if it were that he'd have known months ago. There are vampire laws, breaking any one of them is punishable by death, the lawmakers have their eye on me and it wouldn't surprise me a bit if they were covertly observing Charlie to make sure I haven't let him in on anything. And it's not just me who'd be in trouble, they'd kill him too."

"Aren't we paranoid," said Sue smugly.

"It's not paranoia when my species is ruled by a mind-reading mass murderer," I said. "With similarly spooky people in his employ!"</pre>

<pre>"What is it?" Deloris snapped.

"I . . . I just wanted to tell you that we all understand how brave you are for taking the defense job," Neville stammered.

"What?" she gave him an odd look.

"Well . . . it's just . . . you know what happened to the other Defense Professors, don't you?" Neville looked like he'd rather be anyplace else at the moment. "We figured that's why you took the job, to put an end to all that."

"What happened to them?" the toad faced woman demanded.

Um . . . Harry burned the first one to death, oblivated the second, turned the third into a werewolf, had the fourth replaced by a polyjuiced death eater and then had the death eater kissed, and it's rumored he's done loads of other stuff." Neville reached over to take the woman's hand. "I'd never be able to do what you're doing. Death is one thing, but some of the things Harry's done?" He shivered. "But I'm sure you'll survive and get enough evidence to finally stop him. We knew the Ministry would step in, we just knew it!"

"That really happened to all of them?" Umbridge looked a bit nervous.

"And you took the job despite the fact that the best you could hope for was being turned into a werewolf," Neville agreed. "I also heard that Harry tried to feed Professor Snape to it after the transformation, but no one knows for sure. Just know that all of us are rooting for you, Professor."

"Um . . ."

"Could I have an autograph?" Neville persisted. "And a photo? I'm sure you'll be able to survive the year, but if you don't, well . . . I'd really like to have a memento of the bravest women I've ever met."

"Not right now," Deloris hustled the boy out of her room. "I just remembered that I need to floo the Minister."</pre>

"Yes, Aunty Amelia?"

"Do you remember how you told me you wanted Harry Potter for your birthday?" Amelia asked with a grin.

"I was . . . um . . ." The girl blushed a deep red.

"Well, it took some doing but he's in the bedroom down the hall and will be for the rest of the summer." Amelia smiled at the look of shock on her niece's face. "I know your birthday isn't for another week, but I didn't think he'd like it if I tried to hide him in my closet with your other presents."

Susan stood there gaping a good five minutes after her aunt had left, before she recovered and made a note to herself to be a bit more careful in her requests as apparently her aunt really could do anything!

+

"Remember when Molly blew up that cauldron and turned everything in the room pink?" Amelia giggled. "That was one of the more amusing accidents I remember her making."

"Uh . . . promise to keep this between us?" Arthur asked.

"I promise," Amelia agreed.

"Molly didn't have any accidents in Potions, in fact she got an O in potions on her NEWTS."

"So she?"

"Whenever she got bored or had a score to settle," Arthur agreed.

"I never would have expected that from her. She always seemed so prim and proper."

"That's just what's on the surface. Do a bit of digging and you'll find the real Molly, the one that dosed me with a love potion to get me to notice her."

"She didn't," Amelia gasped.

"I spent a week fawning over the Headmaster's gargoyle before it wore off," Arthur confessed. "It was one of those first sight ones. I went down to the table and made myself a sandwich since I was running late to a Prefect meeting. Didn't enter my system till I was in the hall and the rest is history."

<pre>It wasn't surprising that the Defense Professor made an attempt to murder Harry Potter; after all, it was the rare DADA Professor that didn't try at least once. What was surprising was the fact that he made his attempt in the Great Hall on the second day of classes and of course the fact that it looked like he was going to succeed.

"Harry no," Luna screamed. Everyone in the Great Hall watched as Luna attempted to tackle her friend out of the way of the dark curse speeding towards him.

"No," Hermione gasped. The other girl had managed to get to Harry, moving so fast it was practically apparition, just as the curse hit, striking them both. "No." Harry and Luna were surrounded by the curse's sick yellow glow for a few seconds then it stopped and the two students began fading away. "Professor, do something," she screamed.

At the Head Table, most of the Professors were busy subduing their colleague. The enthusiasm they showed made their view that no matter what the Headmaster might believe, the faculty did not think that attempts to kill the students should be tolerated. That meant the Headmaster was the only person with ability and opportunity to save Harry and Luna.

Snape's contribution, a boot to the groin, was both surprisingly effective and well… just a surprise really. Most of the students and staff later wrote it off as Snape being vindictive over someone killing off the sole remaining Potter, before he got a chance to torment him into insanity.

Dumbledore's wand danced as he attempted to perform a broad range counter curse. He'd been too slow to block the attack but he vowed that he would be damned if he let two of his students die before the rest. Really, it was quite annoying. Each of his students had a scheduled time and place they were supposed to end their mortal existence and Dumbledore was not going to allow anyone to cut in line. Faster and faster his hands moved as he fought a losing battle until finally, the two children disappeared completely.

"Albus?" Minerva asked.

"I've failed," Dumbledore said in horror, thinking of the massive rewrite he'd have to do to his schedule now.

"No wait," Minerva said, "look." The glow had returned and everyone could see two large figures forming. "They're back, they're . . . naked?" The two figures on the floor bore only a vague resemblance to the two children they'd replaced, they looked larger, looked older, looked like they weren't going to stop shagging any time soon.

"Ride me like a pony," the older Luna lookalike screamed, "give it to me harder ahhhhhhhhhh. " The two new figures changed positions three times before a rather vocal finally.

Most of those present claimed it was shock that prevented them from interrupting, but both the Claws and the Puffs walked away with four full pages of notes, while several Snakes and Griffs managed to capture it on film to share with their housemates.

"Are you two quite finished?" Dumbledore asked with a twinkle in his eye.

"Not quite," the older Luna lookalike replied, "why do you ask?"

"I am Albus Dumbledore, the Headmaster of this school. And you are?"

"Luna Potter," she said proudly, "and this is my Husband Harry. We're on our honeymoon and I thought you were dead?"

"That's it, I'm out of here," Snape muttered and quickly fled the scene, not even taking the time to perform his classic robe swish that was his trademark.

"I assure you that I am quite alive," Dumbledore replied, "did you two perhaps go into another dimension for several years before finding comfort in each other's arms?"

"I think perhaps we got caught in a magical accident and swapped places with a couple of our younger analogs in another dimension," Luna mused, "at least that's what it looks like . . . ready for round four Harry?"

"You know it love," Harry agreed, having been stared at enough his entire life that crowds no longer affected him at all, regardless of what he was doing. Several dozen pairs of eyes rounded as the young couple pulled each other close to begin another round of practical sex education.

"Stop that at once," Minerva demanded.

"Why?" Luna sighed.

"I realize that you two are on your honeymoon," Minerva said sympathetically, "but this is not the time or place for such activity."

"I just assumed that since you summoned us here," Harry began.

"We did not summon you two here," Minerva snapped.

"Good to know," Harry mused, "now where were we?"

"You were groping me while I licked your jaw line," Luna explained.

Right," Harry agreed with a lecherous grin, "back to groping."

"Do not go back to groping," Minerva screamed.

"What now?" Harry demanded. "You're really interrupting our personal time here."

"It seems that you've swapped places with two of our students," Dumbledore said happily, "two of your younger selves. Could you tell us where they might have gone?"

"Probably back to our apartment in Monaco," Harry replied, "now if there are no other questions . . ." Without bothering to wait for a reply, Harry's hands and mouth resumed their, apparently stellar, job.

"Ooooh," Luna squealed, "that's the spot and that one too!"

"I'm afraid that there are several more questions," Dumbledore said quickly.

"Damn it, what now," Harry complained; sure it was nice that his old headmaster was alive again, but that was no excuse for interrupting his and Luna's fun time.

"Could we perhaps, take this conversation to my office?"

"We never did get a chance to shag on the Headmaster's desk," Luna said with a coy smile.

"And that's why I love you," Harry said with a grin, "alright we agree. We'll go to your office and shag on your desk."

"I was hoping that perhaps . . ."

"I don't mind if you watch," Luna said with a nod, "it would be rude to kick you out of your office."

"That's not . . . I don't want to watch."

"Well then you're out of luck," Luna said with a frown, "because you can't join."

"I . . . Minerva help."

"OK, she can join, but only for the first half hour, and we'll need Hogwarts' robes for the role play," Harry stated, as Luna squealed.

"Put some clothes on both of you," Minerva demanded.

"I thought we were going to wait until we were in the headmaster's office? Not that I have a problem with doing a little play for the kiddies of course," Harry shrugged.

"No, I mean put on some normal clothes."

"Why?"

"Because it is not appropriate to go around naked like that."

"As a couple on our honeymoon, it is very appropriate. "

"You're around school children."

"And," Harry asked, wondering what exactly her point was. The entire school had faced death from various sources while he was attending it and she was getting upset over a little sex? It's that damn, PBS telethon all over again and I still say we should have won the talent round, god knows they got more donations in the five minutes we were on then their entire last five years combined.'

To the private disappointment of most of the class and the very public disappointment of Lavender, Parvati, and surprisingly Draco Malfoy. 'What?' Draco asked. 'He's hot . . . I mean, she's hot.' Luna and Harry chose to wear clothing for their first class.

"Easy access," Luna explained as the class began, "that's why Harry is wearing a kilt and I'm wearing a skirt. So you guys study something while Harry bends me over our desk."

"Professor?" Hermione's hand waved. "Couldn't you teach us something first?"

"I suppose we could," Harry agreed.

"Awwwww." Luna frowned at the other girl and began sulking.</pre>

<pre>"So you want to have sex with one of my pets?" Harry asked with a smirk. "Why don't you just use one of the school owls? I'm not letting you lay a finger on Hedwig."

"The school owls are not for relieving the sexual frustration of the students," Minerva interjected. "Mr. Malfoy is going to have to buy his own owl."

"Sorry Draco," Harry said with apparent sympathy. "Them's the breaks, I'm sure your father will get you an owl to explore your new desires with . . . well, unless he's squandered the Malfoy family fortune on bribing Minister Fudge."

"I don't want to have sex with a school owl," Draco finally managed to shout.

"Just Hedwig huh?" Harry asked with a frown.

"Prek?" The owl in question asked in horror.

"Don't worry girl," Harry soothed the owl. "I won't let him slake his dark lusts on your innocent body."

"Gawh," Hedwig sighed.

"Not her," Draco screamed. "Her." Pointing in the direction of Gabrielle who to the private amusement of many had assumed her avian form. "I mean . . ."

"You can't have sex with any of my birds," Harry said quickly causing some to groan at the pun. "Sick bastard. What's next, you gonna go after Hermione's little kitty? Hagrid's monster?"

"I'm afraid I'm going to have to rule that Mr. Malfoy can not have sex with any of the animals at Hogwarts that do not belong to him," Dumbledore ruled to the relief of several owls, one toad, a few cats, and some of the unspeakable horrors at Hagrid's hut.</pre>

<pre>"Mordin, we're going to need some plant and blood samples." Harry said as he headed over to the salarian. "According to the geth, there was a warning in the ships log that the local plants could cause mental problems if ingested."

Mordin rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Would explain female's lack of coherency and primitive mindset. Advise against trying to obtain blood sample from female though. Too scared to cooperate."

"Give me a second." Harry said before he jogged to the edge of the cliff. "Accio idiots!" Harry incanted.

"What-"

"Accio is a summoning charm." Shiala explained. She had read a lot of the spell books and was constantly attempting to cast the spells with her biotics. "Idiots… is self-explan-" She stopped and winced as several bodies came soaring up the cliff and crashed into Harry, sending him flying backwards into Tank.

"You forgot to anticipate your enemies movements, Chief." Tank lectured in his usual monotone manner.

+

"Captain on deck!" One of the men shouted and they all jumped to attention.

Shepard didn't say anything as Harry vanished and reappeared next Jack. He grabbed her by the neck, pulling her from her seat before slamming her onto the table smashing her food on her back. He placed a free hand on her lower stomach, which prevented her from struggling too much.

Harry looked around at the crewmembers seriously. "I have been accused of attempted rape. For your benefit I am proving that if I were to attempt rape, I would easily succeed."

+

"Shut the hell up Garrus!" Shepard barked as he dodged another large vehicle.

"Doesn't this thing have weapons?" Shepard demanded irritably.

"It's a taxi cab. It has a fare meter." Liara said waspishly.

"Maybe I should try throwing it at Vasir." Garrus offered.

+

"Numbers, Captain. I need to know what I am dealing with here. Dozens, hundreds?" Shepard demanded.

"Dozens at least. I- I have to go. If something isn't done there could be an investor panic!" She said as she got more worried and walked off.

"When she says 'investor panic', does she mean money problems or that the investors will fear for their lives?" Harry asked.

"Money problems." The group chorused.

+

"Potter Emissary, we-"

"Can't you just call me 'Harry'?"

There was a few moments silence and Harry was sure he could feel his brain heating up as the geth attempted to use more processing power to determine if it actually was possible to call him 'Harry'.

"Personal designation changed."

"Thank Merlin."

+

It was the numerous rachni that were scurrying around and helping with the heavy lifting that caught the eyes of many of the team… or it would have if they weren't more interested in the sight of Harry rolling on the floor in pain whilst holding his crotch.

"I told you I was going to do it, kid." Aethyta glared down at her victim.

Harry struggled to his feet, no one bothered helping as they were all too busy snickering… apart from a few like Liara who was appalled by her father's actions and Tali and Kasumi who were worried about performance issues later. Well Kasumi was worried, Tali just didn't like seeing him in pain.

Harry stood and glared at the older blue woman. Then his hands shot out.

"OW!"

"Harry!"

"Now we are even." Harry decided as he took a step back.

Aethyta was standing there with tears in her eyes as she rubbed her very sore nipples.

"Fuck you Harry! That really hurt." She spat.

"And you think that getting kicked in the balls didn't hurt me?" He retorted.

"Stop it! Both of you!" Liara ordered as she stepped between the pair. "You are supposed to be respected leaders of the galaxy and instead you are acting like children." She scolded.

"She started it." Harry mumbled.

+

Tali scowled at the name of the Consort.

Her light purple skin took on a darker hue and she seemed to shake indecisively on the spot.

Harry was shocked when the lithe quarian leapt at him and pressed her soft lips against his passionately.

Both Harry and the geth had mentally stalled.

Lefty was literally stuck in mid-step.

Shiala was crowing triumphantly in her head.

After several seconds Tali broke away breathlessly. She looked him in the eye with a glare. "We will be together again soon and we will be picking up from here." She informed him.

"Er… erm…"

"Just nod and say 'Yes Ma'am'." Shiala instructed with a grin.

"Yes Ma'am." Harry said in a daze.

Shiala grabbed the younger girl and dragged her to the airlock as Lefty's foot finally reached the floor.

"Potter Emissary, that event caused the near loss of two geth dropships. We will need warning before Creator Tali performs that action again." Lefty reported.

"Again?" Harry was still dazed.

Unknown to Harry, Lefty and the rest of the geth had sent a video to Chakwas to ask for advice on how to handle Harry's current mental issues.

Lefty walked up to Harry and slapped him on the back of his head.

"BLOODY HELL!" Harry shouted as he rubbed his now sore skull.

"We apologise. Doctor Chakwas informed us that this was the best procedure to restore your full mental functionality. It appears to be quite effective."

Harry just growled. "Tell the Doctor that this had better fall under patient/doctor confidentiality."

+

"Emissary, could you explain why there is a ship claiming to be part of the Emissary's Free Republic requesting permission to enter Alliance space?" An old grizzled and balding man asked.

"Because they refuse to call themselves something else and are too polite to just barge in." Harry said factually.

The Admiral frowned.

The Admiral on the left tried to stifle a smile as he clarified the question. "We were hoping for more of a confirmation that these are your people and what their purpose here on Earth is."</pre>

<pre>Harry Potter you're . . . wait, you're Lovegood's girl aren't you?"

"No that's Harry Potter, James Potter's boy." Luna said slowly. "Everyone knows that."

"False alarm folks," the Auror called over his shoulder. "Sorry about that Potter, we didn't realize you had a Lovegood with you."

"What's that have to do with anything?" Harry asked in confusion.

"Just a sec." The Auror reached into his pocked and pulled out a large book. After flipping through it for a few seconds, he marked a passage and handed the book to Harry.

"Lovegoods are allowed to do whatever they want so long as it doesn't hurt anyone important," Harry read. "What's this mean."

"It means that she can do anything she feels like doing that doesn't hurt anyone important like the Minister," the Auror said slowly. "You wouldn't believe how much easier things became after they enacted that law." He glanced down at the book. "Five hundred years ago."

"But . . . "

"And before you ask, no. It doesn't work to throw them into Azkaban."

"They like that," another Auror said with a horrified shudder.

"Best birthday party ever," Luna agreed.

"We lost half our dementors that year," the Auror continued with a haunted look in her eyes, "turns out dressing them in pink and forcing them to have a tea party destroys them. I can still hear the screams when I close my eyes to sleep at night."</pre>

<pre>Harry shook his head and went about filling out the forms in front of him.

"Go ahead and list anything the Dursleys let you use on a regular basis," Lichfield advised. "As long as you can reasonably say that you believe they gave them to you, you should be covered. If they don't like it, let them go complain their authorities that goblins stole their furniture and see what good that'll do them."

+/

"Right then," Dirtclaw said. "Where do you want the tub?"

"The tub?" Harry asked, thinking for one crazy moment that the goblins had ripped out the Dursleys bathtub. 'That had not been on any form that I had signed,' Harry thought to himself, though he supposed Lichfield might have added it on there as some sort of joke.

"The tub," Dirtclaw repeated. "The one with your clothes," he explained, pointing to the small group of goblins struggling to haul a glossy white metal contraption trailing tubes and a trickle of water behind it.

Harry broke down laughing. The goblins had stolen Aunt Petunia's prized washing machine.

The dreaded Dr. Puckle smiled one of her rare half–smiles as her husband concentrated overly hard on reading an article about a mad horse–faced woman in Surrey that claimed a horde of goblins and a rock star had stolen her washing machine.</pre>

"Uh . . . no Luna, I was just dropping by to say Hello."

"Why not?" The girl asked with a pout.

"Well . . . you don't owe me a life debt and you haven't betrayed me . . . have you?"

"No but I was hoping that you wouldn't let that stop you," Luna replied. "Please? Or if you won't make me a slave then will you be my boyfriend?"

"You want to be my girlfriend?"

"Uh huh," Luna agreed.

"And you don't mind that I've got a few slaves . . . that happen to be good looking witches that would do anything I tell them?"

"Why would I?" Luna asked in confusion. "You'll share right?"

"Share?"

"When you have them do kinky things," Luna said. "I can join in can't I?"

"Uh . . . sure Luna."

"Then of course I don't mind," Luna said quickly. "I'm not sure why I would."

"Wanna go on a date then?"

"Can we go to the zoo?" Luna asked in excitement. "I love feeding the monkeys."

"Sure Luna."

"And the lion is always so happy when he eats them," Luna added as they walked out the door.

"Eats . . . the monkeys?"

"What else would he eat?"</pre>

<pre>"Ah, Mister Anderson, somehow dead a century early and still cannot make it to my office in less than three days. I am Director Naumes." The acerbic tone of Director Naumes clashed with the cheery office the woman kept. "Between Potter, Summers, Son, and Jackson I have enough problems without adding your recent hijinks to the list."

"What I was supposed to let David die?"Scott had never been one to lie down and take a bollocking. He especially wasn't going to do so when he did something he thought was right.

"In a word: Yes. I know David was your friend, but it was his time. The chipper would have been less painful than the stomach cancer that he was diagnosed with a few days before." Director Naumes shot back with a steely glare. "Now, thanks to the fact that you missed your first appointment, we've had to cure that for him. We had one window to get you back there and you blew it."

"Blew it?"

"When you gave your ticket to Griphook." Naumes snarled. "Sure, another selfless deed under your belt. You're as bad as the other four that way." Getting up she walked over to the bar and grabbed a tumbler and poured herself two fingers of scotch. "Listen, Scott, you have enough good karma under your belt that in a few weeks you were about to meet the woman of your dreams. In a month you'd be married and spending your honeymoon with her and her two girlfriends who she shares everything with. You would have died at the age of one hundred and forty thanks to a heart attack during a foursome, your wife and girlfriends joining you in the afterlife. Well, you managed to completely screw the pooch on that life."

"So, no rewinding my life and putting it back on track?"

"In two words: Fuck No!" Naumes drank the scotch then decided perhaps Vodka would be a better idea. "Your universe is very limited in magical energy, not the amount but how much can be fiddle. Sure, the Boss could get it done, but he's already laid down the mysterious ways line when I asked." Downing a shot of the really hard stuff she continues. "Seems we can't send you back or let you go forward. Well, not the normal way."

"What?"

"Well, while I was distracted with your mess, one of my most important clients managed to make your catastrophe look like spilled milk." Naumes pour another shot and downed it. "Potter decided he had enough. Little blighter buggered off to Heaven without waiting for his appointment. Bloody Pillock has us all over the barrel just waiting for the Bollocking from the Boss."

"And this has what to do with me how?" Scott had to admit Naumes could hold her liquor. Sure he could have done that much and barely even feel tipsy, but she was smaller than he was.

"Well, since you are here and supposed to live another hundred years minimum, we're sending you to live his life." Naumes grinned. "Congratulations, you have been upgraded from Zero to Hero."</pre>

<pre>All the adults in the room, bar Auror Tonks, huddled around faintly glowing dish like object, the Pensieve and bent forward till their faces were submerged in it. Hermione craned her neck trying to discern the rare and wonderful magical artefact when her attention was interrupted by an excited squeal.

It was Auror Tonks, as she pounced upon Harry, who easily caught her in his arms with a grunt, before giving him a sloppy kiss right on his lips.

"Eww Dora. That's gross. How many times do I have to tell you to not do it?" Harry yelled at her. But she just laughed dismissively, "Oh, don't complain, Kit, you know that you enjoy it when I do it!"

And then dipped her face down again as if to kiss him again, but this time Harry was prepared and raised his head slipping his tongue in her mouth,

"Eww Harry, that's gross...we are like second or third cousins something!" shrieked Tonks and jumped away from him.

"Never stopped you Blacks before!" replied back Harry without missing a beat.</pre>

<pre>Slamming the memory into an iron casket, Harry snapped back to the present with a pounding heart. Ginny was staring at him concernedly.

"Are you all right, Harry?" she asked.

Before Harry could wet his mouth enough to speak, Luna spoke."She'll say yes, Harry. She likes you, you know."

Ginny flushed red. "Luna!"

Despite himself, Harry flushed, too. "Err…thanks, Luna."

"Are you going to ask her?" Luna inquired. "Or have the Wrackspurts latched onto you?"

"No Wrackspurts," Harry managed to say. "Just…" How was it that no matter how old he was that talking to Ginny always made him tongue-tied? "Ginny…would you…go to the ball with me?"

There. The question had been asked.

Ginny blushed a brilliant scarlet at the question. "Really, Harry?"

His tongue was working for this. "I don't see anyone else I'm asking," he said.

Ginny smiled broadly. "Then yes. Yes, I will."

Harry smiled as well, happy despite his earlier doubts and the memory he had been sucked into. "Brilliant."

"I don't know, Harry," Ron muttered, looking slightly ill. "I'll do it tomorrow. Yeah…I'll do it tomorrow."

"You'll do no such thing," Harry said, amused. "You'll ask her tonight."

Ron shot him an aggrieved look. "And I suppose you already asked Ginny?"

"In the library," Harry responded cheerfully.

"What did she say?"

"Yes, of course," Harry said.

Ron choked. "'Yes, of course'?"

Harry rolled his eyes. "I was joking, Ron. I was nervous like hell. Almost didn't ask her." He nudged his friend's shoulder. "Since I made it, it's your turn now."

"It can't wait for tomorrow?" Ron shifted nervously.

Hermione sat in the seat before them, startling Ron so badly he upended his ink canister. "What can't wait? Oh, Ron… Scourgify." When the ink had vanished from Ron's parchment and his robes, she continued, "That essay from McGonagall is due tomorrow. Please don't tell me you haven't finished it!"

"Finished it last week," Harry said.

"When?"Ron asked incredulously. "I don't see you doing any schoolwork anymore!"

"The library," Harry said, aware of the look Hermione was sending his way. "Ron…didn't you want to ask Hermione something?"

"Ask me what?" Hermione demanded. "If it's help on that essay, I'll read it but won't do more than that! You had over a week to do it—"

"It's not homework, Hermione!" Ron said, sounding strangled. "It's…" He took a deep breath to fortify himself. "Wouldyougototheballwithme?" The question was one long garbled mess that even Harry couldn't make head or tail of.

Hermione's brow furrowed. "I don't think I understood that."

"The ball!" Ron sounded desperate. "Would you…you know…go with me?"

Hermione looked both startled and pleased. A light red suffused her cheeks. "Are you asking me?"

"I'm not asking Harry," Ron grumbled, his ears a red to match his hair.

"Oh, well…" Hermione stammered.

Ron seemed absolutely tortured.

"Yes, I'll go!" Hermione said, beaming.

Ron didn't seem to believe his ears. "You…you said yes?"

"Yes, you great prat. I said yes!" Hermione had a fond look on her face.

Harry couldn't stop the smile from crossing his face. It caught Hermione's attention and she fixed her brown eyes on him.

"I meant to ask, Harry," she said, "what did McGonagall want?"

"Just to tell me that the champions have the opening dance of the ball."

Hermione straightened in attention. "Doesn't that mean that you need a date? Do you know who you're asking?"

"Harry already asked someone," Ron said, sounding a little peeved at being forced to ask so early.

Hermione seemed surprised. "You already did? But we just learned about the ball today!"

Ron gave a pointed cough. "I asked you today."

"Well, yes, but…Harry's different…" Hermione's voice trailed off.

"Shyer, you mean?" Harry suggested dryly. "I didn't ask my date in public."

"Who is it?" Hermione asked.

Aware that most of the room was listening in on their conversation, Harry decided to have a little bit of fun. He mentally debated as to whether he should sound a little lovesick but decided that might be laying it on a bit thick. Thus, with a completely straight face, he said, "Draco."

Ron gave a cough that sounded oddly like a laugh while Hermione's eyebrows disappeared into her hairline. There was a thud elsewhere that suggested some shocked Gryffindor had dropped something.

"Draco, Harry?" Hermione asked uncertainly. "As in…Draco Malfoy?"

"I don't know many other Malfoys in Hogwarts," Harry said, putting the appropriate amount of confusion in his tone.

A glint of suspicion entered Hermione's eyes. "You're not having us on, are you, Harry?"

"What makes you think I'd joke about something like this?" Harry made sure to sound insulted, though he was having a tough time keeping his face straight. "I've never known a man like him before!"

Then, very deliberately and glad that his back was facing the common room, Harry mouthed, "Play along."

Ron promptly did so with great enthusiasm. "That squirmy ferret?! Harry, why'd you ask him? He hates us! He insults you every chance he gets!"

"He doesn't hate me!" Harry protested indignantly. "It's just his way of professing his undying love!"

There was another distinct thudding sound.

"Are you sure you're not imagining things, Harry?" Hermione asked anxiously.

"I asked him!"

"But…he's a…boy."

"Who are we talking about here?" Harry raised an eyebrow, uncomfortably aware that this was how his thoughts had been running prior to asking Ginny. "One of the first-years?"

"You're fourteen!" Ron said, his eyes gleaming with wicked humor.

"So's he!"

Someone choked in the distance.

"He's a squirmy ferret!" Ron argued.

"How do you know that? For all you know, he could really be a swan!"

There was another distinct choking noise, accompanied by another thud.

"All we're saying, Harry," Hermione broke in, placing a hand on Ron's arm, "is that we're…concerned." That was a nice touch on her part. "Did you really ask him?"

Harry scowled and stood up. "I like him!" he proclaimed dramatically. "And he likes me, too!"

Ron jumped up. "He's only playing you, Harry! He's a filthy Slytherin!"

"Playing, is he?" Harry demanded furiously. "I'll show you lot!"

He gave his friends a quick wink and stormed through the common room to exit the portrait, leaving a stunned silence in his wake.

Smirking wickedly, Harry figured that this joke would make up for not putting this Severus in a tutu.

The next day the rumor that Harry Potter was taking Draco Malfoy (or the other way around) to the Yule Ball was all over Hogwarts. Harry was aware of stares and whispers as he sat down to breakfast by his friends.

"I hope you know what you're doing, Harry," Hermione whispered as he reached for a plate of toast. "He looks absolutely furious."

"Does he?" Harry snuck a glance at the Slytherin table and saw that Draco did indeed have a very black expression on his face. "Hmm…he does."

"Half the House believes you, mate," Ron said in a low voice. "The rest thinks he's got you cursed or that you ate something bad."

"Who did you ask anyway, Harry?" Hermione asked curiously.

"Tell you later," Harry promised, looking up as the owls swooped in to deliver their post. "Ooh, brilliant."

Hedwig swept in on her majestic wings, bearing a rolled up piece of parchment.

Hermione and Ron leaned forward expectantly, but Hedwig didn't fly towards Harry, instead winging her way to the Slytherin table.

"You didn't!" Hermione gasped, staring at him in shock.

"He did," Ron moaned, seeing Hedwig land in front of the silver-haired Slytherin. "He's going to kill us…"

The entire Great Hall had hushed upon seeing Harry Potter's owl approach Draco Malfoy, his archenemy. She held out her claw insistently, ignoring the incredulous look Draco was shooting her.

The insistent hoot of Hedwig echoed throughout the entire hall as she clicked her beak impatiently at Draco. Finally, Draco took the rolled up parchment, looking incredulous when Hedwig snatched up a piece of bacon from his plate before swooping up into the air.

Everyone stared expectantly at Draco, though he simply dropped the parchment on the table as if it would poison him.

Harry had anticipated that his friend would do such a thing. Thus, the parchment fluttered into the air the moment it touched the table top and unrolled itself with a flourish, dropping a red rose onto a horrified Draco's plate.

Ron gave a quiet whimper even as he continued watching. Hermione's eyes were as wide as an owl's and she didn't seem to be breathing. The rest of Gryffindor table, like the other tables, was alternating glances between Harry, who kept a carefully neutral face, and Draco, whose face had turned from horror to an impassive mask that most of the school recognized.

To the rest of the Slytherin table, the parchment bore a flowery invitation to the ball. To Draco's eyes only, it bore two words and a signature: Play along. H.P.

Harry had no desire to risk his fledgling relationship with Draco. At least this way the blonde was somewhat forewarned and could retaliate if he so wished.

At the Slytherin table, Draco stared at the note for a long moment. Then, finally, he pulled his wand out and incinerated the invitation. For extra measure, the rose went up in smoke as well.

Ron winced as the tendrils of smoke rose. "Ouch, Harry."

Harry sighed for good measure. "I suppose I should have signed the note," he whispered. "But it's good to know he's loyal."

A first-year Gryffindor who'd just taken a sip of juice promptly spit it back out upon hearing Harry, spraying Lee.

Lee shot the first year a glare, but didn't say anything as Draco had left the Slytherin table and was sweeping towards the Gryffindor table. His face was a dark mask as he approached Harry.

"Potter." His voice was a dark growl.

Harry blinked innocently, making sure his tone had the appropriate amount of confusion in it. "What's the matter, Draco?"

"What was the meaning of that?" Draco demanded.

"Hedwig, Draco?"

Draco glared at Harry. "You know exactly what I'm talking about!"

"What'd I do?"

The Slytherin turned slightly pink at the question, though his jaw tightened. "That…letter, Potter."

Harry frowned. "It was just a letter, wasn't it? Nothing untoward in it?"

Before Draco could press the matter any further, Minerva joined them. "Is something the matter, Malfoy?"

Draco's gray eyes flickered back and forth between Minerva and Harry before taking in the rest of the silent Great Hall. "Nothing, Professor."

Just when it seemed like the matter would be cleared up without any further problems, Severus swept down the aisle, his sallow face a blank mask. "Is there a problem, Malfoy?"

Harry saw Ron frown angrily and discreetly kicked his friend in the ankles before the redhead could do anything. He didn't think Draco would do anything considering he had just told Minerva nothing was wrong.

"No, sir," Draco denied, looking distinctly nervous.

Severus took a second to glance from Draco to Harry before mildly saying, "Detention, Potter."

This time even Harry kicking Ron in the ankles couldn't shut the Weasley up. "What? Why?"

Even Minerva looked slightly scandalized. "You had better have a good reason, Severus."

"He is wearing an inappropriate uniform."

Harry looked down at his robes, which was the standard Hogwarts uniform, and raised an eyebrow.

"It's untidy," Severus said matter-of-factly. Harry swore he saw a gleam of humor in the man's eyes.

The only part of Harry's outfit that even remotely resembled untidy was his tie. If Severus was stooping so low, he really must be desperate.

Judging from Minerva's skeptically raised eyebrow, she wasn't really buying Severus's excuse. But since Harry's tie was slightly untidy, she let it go with a small "humph" and a glare in Severus's direction. Draco was looking slightly confused at his professor's unusually weak excuse for hauling Harry into detention – never mind that Severus had brought Harry in on less before.

When the two teachers and Draco had departed, most of Gryffindor was staring sympathetically in Harry's direction.

"Sucks, Harry!" Seamus sympathized.

Harry offered a shrug and pulled off his tie. After inspecting it, he crumpled it up into a small little ball, eliciting a round of shocked gasps.

Hermione was resigned. "You'd better know what you're doing."

"Oh, don't worry. I am," Harry asserted, unrolling the now entirely crumpled tie. He put it back on and stood up. "I'm headed off to Hagrid's class. You with me?"

An amused voice broke in on Harry's reading. "So have I been dumped for Malfoy?"

Harry looked up from his Runes book to see Ginny smiling at him. His heart stuttered a bit, and he checked the chest he'd slammed the memory in: it was locked tight.

"What do you think?" Harry asked lightly, closing the book.

Ginny sat down. "Methinks someone is playing a prank."

Harry grinned, leaning back in his chair. "Methinks that someone is bold."

Ginny rolled her eyes. "Methinks that someone is sitting right in front of me."

Harry gave a short laugh and gave up all pretense of being innocent. "All right… So I made up a lie last night. I just wanted to teach them all a lesson for eavesdropping."

"Pranking Malfoy… I don't think even the twins have ever been as bold as you have." She glanced pointedly at Harry's very sorry looking tie. "I hope you know what you're doing."

"He wants crumpled, I'll give him crumpled," Harry said amiably. "I don't have Potions today anyway."

"And a good thing, too! You don't need more trouble on your hands!" Hermione's voice said reprovingly. She sat down by them, dumping her Arithmancy books on the table. "And for your information, Malfoy has been terrorizing the first years. I hope you're proud of yourself, Harry."

Harry gave a shrug, not feeling regretful at all. 'That's Draco, all right.'

Giving it up for a lost cause, Hermione focused on something else, looking at both Harry and Ginny and raising an eyebrow. "I didn't expect to see you two sitting together."

Harry smiled. "Hermione, meet my date."

Hermione was silent for a long moment, looking back and forth between the two. "You're serious, aren't you?"

"No. I asked George, who is secretly Ron's other sister," Harry said sarcastically.

"He wears pink," Ginny offered.

"Come off it!" Hermione snapped, blushing. "I didn't mean it like that! I really am happy that you two are going together."

"And I'm glad that my prat of my brother asked you," Ginny replied cheerfully.

"Where is Ron anyway?" Hermione asked, looking around.

"Kitchens," Harry said. "He was hungry."

"Honestly," Hermione muttered. "Can he think about anything other than food?"

"You can still change your mind," Ginny said.

Hermione was shaking her head. "It's Ron." She looked at Harry. "Have you gotten McGonagall's homework straight? I don't think I quite got the last part right…the theory on Transfiguring animals?"

"That's it," Harry confirmed. The completed essay was sitting at the bottom of his bag.

"Have you gotten started on it already?" Hermione peered at Harry's book, which looked like a Transfigurations textbook to her.

"Preliminary reading," Harry lied. "You?"

Hermione shot her Arithmancy book a look. "I'll start on it tonight."

"Get started on Ron, too," Ginny said. "He'll put it off till the last minute."

Hermione rolled her eyes. "Don't get me started on that." She shot Harry a look. "You really should take care of that tie, Harry."

Harry flicked it at her. "I'll do it before detention."

But as Harry went for his detention, his tie was still as crumpled as it had been since breakfast.

Severus raised an eyebrow at seeing it. "Very tidy, Potter," he said dryly.

"Thank you," Harry said cheerily. "Have a nice day?"

Severus shot Harry a glare. "The rumor, Potter?"

Harry shrugged and took a seat on a desk. He blocked the hex the professor sent his way. "They were eavesdropping. I decided to play a prank."

"A prank?"Severus sent a Stinging Hex that he had to block a moment later as Harry turned it back.

"Draco can have his own fun," Harry pointed out. He shot a Jelly-Legs Jinx. "I don't think he'll do much, though."

Severus scowled, raising a shield. "What were you thinking this morning?"

"It gave you an excuse, didn't it?" Harry asked. "I thought you were better than that, though. Was my untidy tie the only thing you could think of?"

"Unlike your previous interactions with Malfoy, you weren't actually doing anything." The remark was punctuated by a vicious curse.

Harry used a chair to block and jumped off the desk. "You should be happy that we've sorted out our differences." He redirected another nasty curse that would have taken his tongue off. "If we're not sticking with low-level spells, we should take this elsewhere."

Scowling at the fact that he couldn't seem to ruffle Harry's feathers, Severus aimed a Color-Changing Charm at Harry's hair, only to find that he had to duck a Cheering Charm a split-second later.

The next day during his free period Harry sought Draco out, finding him in the Owlery.

Draco didn't say anything to Harry. He continued to watch the horizon, having sent his owl off shortly before.

Harry waited patiently, stroking Hedwig as he did. What he had to ask of Draco wasn't that important.

"You've some guts, Potter," Draco said finally.

Harry looked up from Hedwig's feathers, only to find himself still staring at the back of Draco's head. "I'm sorry?"

Draco turned slightly. "You know what I'm talking about. Pranking me like that in the middle of the Great Hall…You've got some guts. Either that or you're incredibly stupid and looking to die."

"Neither," Harry said easily, ignoring the confused look Draco shot him. "How's it going?"

Draco folded his arms. "You're not fooling me with that innocent act, Potter. You're just as Slytherin as I am."

Harry was silent for a moment longer, letting Hedwig fly back up to the rafters. Then he turned fully to the blonde Slytherin. "Do you recall the offer you made me before?"

Draco stiffened imperceptibly. "What of it?"

"I'm calling it in," Harry said.

When Harry didn't immediately continue, Draco snapped, "Well? What do you want?"

Harry smiled broadly. "I want you to teach me how to dance."

When Draco gaped at him, Harry knew that this had been the right choice. Plus, it wasn't often he got to see the Malfoy heir this gobsmacked.</pre>

<pre>"Well, look at this," a familiar voice called out. Harry let out a white groan as Draco Malfoy sauntered up to their table, followed by his posse. "Leave it to Potter to make his first fully evolved Pokémon a puffy blimp."

"Draco!" Harry said, putting as much false cheer as he could in his voice. "I thought about you over vacation!"

"Finally realized I was your better and cursed the fact that you didn't accept my offer of friendship when you had the chance?"

"Sort of," Harry said. "You see-and by the way my first fully evolved Pokémon was Dobby... you remember, I tricked your father out of him- anyway, I was in the Ilex Forest being attacked by some Mightyenas and all I could think was "Oh, how I wish Draco was here! These dogs might bite him and get so sick from the taste of his skin that they'd flee!"." He glanced at Pansy. "I guess Mightyenas have stronger taste buds than you." Before the sour-faced Slytherin girl could start yelling at him Harry decided to complete his set of insulted Slytherins. "Crabbe, Goyle, I see you decided to switch places this year. Good for you... lets you guys see a different part of Malfoy's face."

The two large brutes looked at each other, realized they were, in fact, in the wrong spots, and quickly switched places.

"Oh... nevermind."

Draco glared at Harry for a moment before a cocky little smile formed on his lips. "Get in your sad little jests, Potter... it is all you have, isn't it?" He turned to Pansy and snorted. "Look at him, bragging about getting some evolution stones as a gift. I don't need them as gifts! My father would give me them anytime so long as I asked!"

"Then ask," Luna said with a sweet smile. Draco looked at her, brow furrowing, and the blonde stood up. She climbed onto the table, Luna Jr. tossing her the cane she'd 'liberated' from Lucius, and began to cry out like a carnival barker. "Attention Scowling Slytherins! Draco Malfoy will be handing out free Evolution Stones! He wants to do it to prove how much better he is than Harry Potter! Put your order in now! Supplies are not limited!" She sat back down and stared at Draco with utter admiration. "You are so generous, Draco!"

The 'Prince of Slytherin' went deathly pale as he realized that he was now stuck either telling his father he'd wrote a check he couldn't actually cash... or admit he was bluffing and becoming a laughingstock. Glancing at the Slytherins that were eyeing him up he knew there was no chance of him getting out of this clean.

"Luna...wow," Hermione said in admiration as Draco slinked away.

"I decided I'm going to be evil this year," Luna said. She placed her hands on the table and looked at her friends, a wicked gleam in her eyes. "Now... how do we kill Superman?"

Before her friends could become worried about this new turn Prof. Snape walked over to the table and looked down at them. "Are you young lions causing trouble?" he asked coolly.

"No sir," Harry said, fighting a smile. "I merely told Draco how much I missed him, stated a fact about Pansy, and complimented Crabbe and Goyle. Luna then let everyone know how kind Draco is."

"...5 points from Gryffindor for not using indoor voices, and another five for standing on tables," Snape said. "And be mindful who you torment."

Ron waited for Snape to be out of earshot before complaining. "Geez, I can't believe he is still treating you so rough!"

Harry shrugged his shoulders and recalled Togekiss. "That's just the way he is. He might be my step-uncle-"

"Do we call him your stencle?" Ginny asked.

"I prefer combining Snape and Uncle," Neville said. "A Snancle."

+

Things took a turn when, instead of allowing them to eat, the old man smiled at them, a twinkle in his eye. "Now, I have a final few announcements. Every year I tell you all that the current school year will be unique. This year is no different. This year our school will, for the first time, be host for a tradition that dates back nearly 400 years." The students murmured at this and Dumbledore allowed them a moment before he continued. "This year we will be hosting 7th Year students from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos." The buzz grew in intensity and Dumbledore merely smiled, enjoying the sight of his students vibrating with curiosity. "This year we will be hosting 78th Annual-"

"Hunger Games?" Luna called out, only for Neville, Ginny and Hermione to quickly grab her and clap their hands over her mouth.

Dumbledore merely chuckled at her comment before continuing. "We will be hosting the 78th Grand Trainer Tournament!"</pre>

<pre>Fortunately, as it was a Sunday, they were all planning on having breakfast, then collapsing, and sleeping off their hangover.

“Potter!” Snape hissed, as they entered. He stood between them and their table.

“It’s Snape,” Harry said delightedly. “How’s your office? Did you get caught in the water, I was hoping it would conf..canf… make you get clean,” he finished brightly.

“You’re drunk,” Snape sneered.

“Undoubtedly, and you're ugly,” Harry replied. “And I shall be sober in the morning. But let’s not get personal, eh Snivellus?”

“What did you call me?” Snape yelled.

“A yeasty, hedge-born, foot-licker?” George asked.

“A festering boil on a rancid buttock?” Fred tried.

“An immoral sadist who gets sexual satisfaction out of degrading children,” Hermione suggested, as she leant against Viktor for support.

“No,” Harry said, “I think it was Snivellus. But don’t mind him; he’s just a greasy Death Eater with bad personal hygiene who had an unhealthy thing for my mum. Disturbing, that is.”

Snape went white, then red, then white. “You arrogant…”

Whatever else Snape was going to say was irrelevant, as Harry, slightly unsteadily, kicked him in the stomach. The follow up was grabbing Snape’s head and guiding it to his knee, as his reflexes kicked in.

He felt Snape’s nose break, and dropped him to the floor. “Ewwww,” he said, waving his hands wildly in the air. “I touched Snape’s hair! Yeuch!”

“Mr Potter,” Dumbledore called.

“Hey, it’s the Headmaster,” Harry said. “Wave to him.”

As requested, everyone waved at the Headmaster, who looked disappointed.

“My office, I think.”

“You think about your office,” Harry agreed. “I’m gonna think about breakfast then sleep.”

“That was an order.”

“What was?”

“My office.”

“What about it?”

“You are to go to it.”

“I am?” he asked. “Fred, did I have an appointment booked for this morning?”

Fred pulled out a piece of parchment. “No,” he said, “This morning is sleeping, followed by quiet hangover time.”

Harry turned and smiled brightly at the headmaster. “You must be mistaken; I’ve not got an order with you this morning.”

“Mr Potter,” McGonagall said.

“Hi cat-lady,” Harry called back.

McGonagall blinked at him.

“I always wanted a cat growing up, they’re cool,” Harry said to George.

“We had a puppy once, we loved it.”

“What happened?”

Fred looked down, “It’s a pain that never ends,” he said. “We’ll tell you later.”

“Poor Fred,” Harry said, giving him a big hug.

“Mr Potter!”

“Hey, it’s Dumbledore, let’s wave to him.”

“I think you did that already,” Hermione said.

“Really?”

She nodded.

“Wow, you really are smart,” he agreed. “Is it breakfast yet? I’m hungry.”

“Mr Potter,” Albus tried for the third time. “Will you please go to my office, so we can try and sober you up, and then discuss whether or not you’ll be expelled?”

“Expelled?” Harry gasped.

Dumbledore nodded.

“Hey, if I’m expelled, I won’t have to take part in this stupid tournament!”

“No fair,” Cedric called. He stumbled over to Snape and pulled out his wand. Whatever spell he slurred seemed to work by making Snape completely bald. “Me too.”

“That looks fun,” Fleur announced sleepily. “Here, take my sister,” she said, passing a still sleeping Gabrielle to Harry. She walked over to Snape, and kicked him as hard as she could in the balls.

“Stop,” Albus roared.

“Ouch,” Harry said. “Vik?”

“Ya,” Viktor agreed. “If that’s alright with Herminny?”

Hermione nodded. “You’ve got a career,” she agreed. “And enough money to keep me in books.”

Viktor smiled happily and cursed Snape as well. “That’s for trying to curse Hermioninny,” he muttered.

“Great,” Harry said. “Are we expelled now?”

Dumbledore growled.

“Yay,” Harry cheered. “George, what’s my biggest property where we can go celebrate getting out of this stupid contest?”

“Potter Castle,” George replied. “But you’ve got a smaller and nicer place in France.”

“France?” Harry asked. “All the cool people live there, and Germany, and they do wine!”

“They do,” Fred agreed. “We better get expelled as well.”

“YOU WILL STOP THIS NONSENSE IMMEDIATELY!”

Harry looked at the roaring Dumbledore. “He looks pissed off,” he said in a stage whisper.

“Yeah,” Cedric agreed.

“You think he’ll do a Snape?”

“What?” Cedric asked, “A hundred billion points from Gryffindor for breathing?” he sneered in an accurate impersonation of the unconscious professor.

Harry cheered. He looked around, did a full circle, and then spotted Dumbledore. The Professor was on his feet, glowing with magic, and a furious expression on his face.

“Hey,” he said, “it’s Dumbledore, let’s all wave to him.”

As a group, they all waved at Dumbledore.

Harry looked along the table. Madame Maxime was the only one not glaring at them; she looked like she was having trouble keeping her laughter in.

“Hey,” Harry said. “I’ve got a great idea; let’s connect the bounty on Snape’s arm! There’s this guy that pays lots of money for that, and we could buy more drink with the money!”

“Yeah,” Crusher cheered. He pulled out an axe from his pocket, and then stumbled as a spell from Dumbledore pushed him backward.

“Take cover,” Harry yelled, “we’re under attack!”

His friends followed him as they dived over tables, upending them for protection. He carefully placed Gabrielle on the floor. He grabbed his wand and threw up a ward without thinking about it.

He conjured the most deadly weapon he could think off, and threw it. He turned to watch, as the plate of strawberry ice cream sailed forward and landed on Dumbledore’s head.

“Yeah,” he cheered. “For the honour of us, fight them on benches, fight them on the tables, and never let them take our cranberries!”

Food started appearing all around them, and they all launched it toward the professors.

Fred and George worked together, Fred would throw a melon in the air, and George would smack it with his arm, like a Beaters bat, sending it flying.

Fleur had conjured a large pot, and was throwing bowlfuls out while screeching, “This is what bouillabaisse is supposed to taste like you heathens!”

Viktor and Hermione were throwing hot cross buns that exploded on contact. Melissa and Christophe were creating foaming cream that seemed alive.

Adrienne had a hose pipe full of vinegar that she was spraying over everyone.

“We surrender!”

Harry paused, holding a bag full of pig’s blood. He looked over the barrier, to find that the floor in front of it was a complete mess. Students and Professors were coated in various foodstuffs, and were half-laughing, half-glaring at them.

“You’re not very good shots,” he pointed out. “Hey, it’s Dumbledore, everyone wave at him!”

All his friends stood up and waved cheerily.

Dumbledore thumped his head against the table. “That was something to do with your shield,” he said.

“Hey, that’s a cool shield,” Harry said. “We gotta thank the guy that did that!”

“It’s time for breakfast,” Melissa announced.

“Yay,” Harry cheered. He took a seat and woke Gabrielle up.

“Why is the floor covered in food, and all those people?”

“I don’t know,” Harry said. “There was something about a war, but it’s not important, let’s eat, then we can get sober.”

Gabrielle looked at him. “Wow,” she said in awe, “you’re the most drunk I’ve ever seen!” She looked down the table. “You all are completely drunk!”

“It was the firewhiskey,” Fred said.

“And the scotch,” George added.

“Don’t forget the Vodka,” Viktor added.

“Yeah,” Harry said. “Hungry and sleepy.”

“One more question,” Gabrielle said. “Why is Snape on the floor?”

“Because he’s ugly,” Harry explained.

“Oh, okay.” Gabrielle snuggled into his side as their breakfast arrived. Tilly popped in and squealed. “Cleaning elves are going to be so happy,” she said. “Harry Potter is greatest!”</pre>

<pre>“You’ve got the Wizarding World in an uproar, Kiddo,” Melissa said happily.  “Fudge is barely clinging on to power.  The Prophet launched an all out attack today, on Fudge, Snape, Bagman, and the others.  Half the country is on the verge of open revolt, and you’re in jail for the most ridiculous trumped up charge in existence.

“And it’s become an international scandal.  Gabrielle and Fleur called their parents, who talked to the Veela King and Queen, who bypassed the British government, and asked our Queen what was going on. 

“The Queen asked the Prime Minister to investigate, and well, let’s say he’s been having a crash course into our anachronistic laws.

“The French and German governments have protested strongly about the kidnappings.

“Cedric’s dad has been leading an internal revolution in your name; he thinks that you walk on water for helping his son like you have been, and giving him a chance to show his worth.

“Cho’s parents have been putting financial pressure on the Ministry, they’re heavily into importing, and are the sole suppliers in this country of a lot of items the Ministry needs.

Harry smiled.  “How is everyone?”

“Working together, Hermione’s been ensconced in the Library – skipping classes even!  Fred and George have been making allies left, right and centre in your name, and then using them.  Every one else has been helping out as needed.

“There is some bad news, though.”

“Oh?”

“Yeah, Malfoy made some disparaging remarks about you, and well, he fell down five flights of steps.  Three times.  Nasher and Thrasher took it rather personally.  They’re good kids, now that they’ve got a better role model to follow.</pre>

<pre>Bill wasn't having a good day at Hogwarts. His link with Harry wasn't working. It seemed that Harry was blocking him out. He didn't want to what or who Harry was doing right now but he needed Harry's advice to deal with the buffoon in front of him.

Raymond Rosier's father had come to Hogwarts and shouting at him for threating his son. He wasn't even listening to the man's ranting.

With a very bored expression on his face he turned to Dumbledore, who was sitting on the head table, and asked, "Do I have to deal with this obnoxious idiot or will you do something about it?"

"Who are you calling an 'obnoxious idiot'?" The man snarled.

"See what I mean, he is so idiotic he doesn't even understand that he is being addressed." Bill said looking at Dumbledore.

The statement drew laughter from many of the students in the hall. He also could see a smile of the faces of few of the teachers. Unfortunately for him, the man in front of him had enough sense to not draw his wand.</pre>

<pre>Harry sighed, took off his glasses, and rubbed his eyes. He needed minions who were intelligent and motivated so they could take care of things without needing supervision every minute. The problem with intelligent, motivated minions was that they'd go and do something like this.

"Tam, Renee, what on Earth made you think I wanted you to attack the Dursleys?"

"They're terrible! They deserved it! I'd have done worse to them if I could have gotten away with it."

"And it was your birthday! We wanted to get you something special!"

Harry sighed again. "Yes, they were terrible people, but it wasn't all their fault. After I looked into it, I decided I wasn't going to do anything at all to them, and then in a few years I was going to show up in a fancy car with a happy wife and beautiful children, and look down at Dudley still living with his parents with his own fat, stupid wife and kids. It wasn't a very nice dream, but you've stomped on it."

"We're sorry we upset you, Harry."

"Go on. I'll have to think of how to punish you. Some crap job that needs to be done but no one wants, probably. We still have plenty of things to do if we're going to destroy all the purebloods."

"We're really sorry we did it. But I'm glad we're working for you, not Voldemort. I don't think I'd like being tortured every time I did something wrong."

"That, and he's dead. Can't work for a dead guy."

Harry snorted. "Go on. I'll talk to you later about your crap jobs."</pre>

<pre>"Wait, what was that last one," Harry asked even as he followed the auror off the lift and down the long corridor. He barely heard the guy on the lift mutter something before he pushed his lever forward and let the doors swing shut. "Never mind, I'm sure I don't want to know," he said ignoring the guys mutterings. "So, we've come all the way here but you haven't said who I'm supposed to have an arranged marriage with."

The pink haired woman stopped and turned to look at the boy, her eyes hard for a second before they softened. "You seem to have been taking this awfully well," she said as she sidestepped the boy's question. "You know, if it was me and I found out my old man and some mass murderer had arranged for me to get married, I'd have a tad bit more to say against it," she said before she continued to lead him to the correct office.

"Oh," he muttered before shrugging even though she couldn't see it. "Well, I could get mad but why bother doing that," Harry asked questioningly. "I mean, I don't know much about my parents so whatever I can get helps," he explained. "If my dad thought it was a good idea that I marry whoever it is, than I guess I'll gladly accept it," he said with a smile. "Although, if he was friends with a mass murderer I guess I could be worried, but since I don't know what type of person my dad was, I don't know what type of person Sirius Black was," he continued.

"Of course, that guy back on the Knight Bus said that Black was Voldemort's right hand man, so maybe my parents were followers of his too before he attacked us," Harry said with a shrug. "The way it stands, I'll never know what kind of people they were except from hearsay. It's not like the Mirror of Erised ever let them talk when I saw it."</pre>

<pre>Harry decided to play game…

He immediately flew toward the opposite side of the field as fast as his Nimbus could take him. Suddenly, he saw Roger Davies, one of the enemy Chasers planning to ram him.

Were they trying to play like Slytherins? Getting angry, Harry curved his broom and went straight to the offending Chaser who was planning to ram him. The crowd didn't need Lee to tell them that Roger was planning to ram Harry off his broom.

Seeing Harry's determined and scary face, he tried to veer off, but Harry ram right past him and kicked his broom, causing Davies to fly off his broom and hit the ground hard.

Ravenclaw was immediately given a free shot, however Roger missed because he was still dizzy from the impact and angry at Harry. Harry knew he had to find the snitch quick! The Ravenclaw Beaters and if possible, the Chasers were aiming for him like crazy. They actually managed to hit him on the shoulder and on his leg twice! Angered, Harry decided to play dirty. He flew straight toward Fred who looked frightened at Harry who took his bat. Seeing no Bludgers but the Quaffle, nearby, Harry flew fast and slammed the bat against the Quaffle hitting a nearby Ravenclaw Chaser who flew off his broom and incidentally hit the Ravenclaw Seeker (Impossible… I know… it's just for extend more information on the Quidditch match) who wasn't looking, causing both of them to fall. Harry threw a deadly glare and threw the bat back to Fred who gave Harry a mixture of awe and surprise. Harry didn't bother looking at what was going on he immediately went back to looking for the snitch.</pre>

<pre>Four hours later...

"Crucio!"

"Yes!" Harry shouted, diabolically. "Again!"

"Crucio!" Ron screamed with savage glee.

From the kitchen, Ginny could only shake her head as she muttered to herself, "Christmas spirit is definitely lacking this

season…What was I thinking? Calling Ron to help is like casting Engorgio on Devil's Snare."</pre>

<pre>Harry let the woman who was definitely NOT his wife down and went in search of this year's newest addition to Hogwarts. He passed a few families he halfway recognised, several crowds of people who looked at him with various states of wariness, and one outright comment about not having enough health insurance to be on the same platform as him.

"How are you feeling Calypso?" Harry asked the eleven year old platinum blonde who looked the splitting image of her mother. "Excited?"

Little Miss Delacour split off from the conversation she'd been having with her cousins and gave him a hug. "Yes, and a little scared maybe, but I have been looking forward to this for so long. It will be fun."

"That it will." Harry said ruffling her hair. "I had to give up your surname to keep you out of Beauxbatons, so I hope you enjoy yourself." Absorbing that little titbit the girl eventually just smiled. "Now, what have I told you to remember?"

"Don't abuse the Dark Arts until forth year."

"Right…"

"If I duel anyone I better win."

"Good…"

"Don't catch pregnancy."

"And most important of all?"

"If the opportunity comes up, and I think I can get away with it, I am to kill Scorpius Malfoy."

"That's my girl." Harry said with a proud smile. "Get on the train, you're going to be late."

Calypso ran off with a bounce, and he stood there just watching in silence for long minutes. Eventually the train rounded a corner and the last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air, Harry was about to make some kind of inane comment or other when Tam interrupted his thoughts.

"Five Galleons she's named Calypso Malfoy within ten years."

"You do not even fucking joke about something like that!"

"Five Galleons I can convince her to name her firstborn son Harry Malfoy." Hermione sniped, making things worse.

"You two are not funny." Harry stated firmly.

"Five Galleons I can convince her, the middle name should be in honour of young Draco's godfather." Albus said, getting in on the action.

"I hate all of you so much!"

||

"'Ze Black Forest?" Fleur half asked, half stated. These were the first words spoken in Harry's presence since the whole marriage revelation, and the caused him to rub his jaw in remembrance. The messy haired sixteen year old had made a tactless comment basically saying that, as they were married, maybe it would be best if they go consummate their relationship.

She'd hit him pretty hard, loosening three and knocking out one of his teeth. A mean right cross was just one of the things Harry wouldn't admit to liking about the woman.

The upshot caused him to do something he regretted, -and he always did regret any and all time spent with Parkinson- just to prove how much he didn't need the French girl.

||

Harry woke suddenly, and the second thing he noticed was a stampede of rhinoceros' rampaging through his brain, in the fifteenth worst hangover he'd ever had. The first thing he'd noticed upon waking was a soft pair of lips wrapped around the base of his… The third thing he noticed was that the person who woke him was Pans Parkinson.

Fuck!

What the hell happened last night?

Okay. Backtrack. They'd been in the Cum and Go… Come and Go Room! And they were trying to cum up with good Voldemort battling ideas. Oh, and Harry arrived at something totally obvious, which none of the others had even considered. There was some other stuff they wanted to do first, but Harry decided it was only a matter of time before Voldemort was toast!

Harry clenched his eyes shut and tried to ignore what was happening below his waist in the waking world.

Bella and Lily and Filch were all pregnant. He remembered that. And Bella said the dates matched so that as soon a Filch gave birth, she could stick her second kid back into the caretaker straight away … Hermione hadn't liked that, and liked it less when she found out the hate filled man's permission hadn't even been asked!

They'd all started drinking in earnest, coming up with baby names. Harry remembered that much, and remembered everyone vetoing his suggestion they name one of the kids after the Horsehead Nebula.

…

'Oh Gods, Merlin, and Circe.' Harry thought, as he went Vesuvius into his hateful companion. 'I remember what happened!'

...

They were all laughing and joking, drinking a whole lot more than was necessary, and generally roughhousing in a boisterous alcohol quaffing kind of way. It was fun.

"How about: Severus Vernon Potter?" Tam suggested, once more applying a subtle Shrinking Charm to Hermione tight while blouse.

"No, No. It needs to start with an 'A,' so his initials will be ASP. 'Cos he'll be a filthy Slytherin, and Asp is a kind of snake, get it?" Harry said laughing. "Adolf Severus Potter!"

"Why are you trying to ruin your younger brother's life before he's even born?" Lily asked, hiding her amusement.

"Because you need to Gender Force a sister for me." Harry replied unashamedly. "I'd love the opportunity to be all protective and intimidating toward all her annoying admirers once she's old enough…" Harry accidently sprayed Hermione's tight white blouse with 'Vinomenti,' soaking her in fine red wine. "…and I never got to do that with Hermione because I actually like Tam!"

Hermione stylishly rubbing away most of the dark red liquid, and showing all the guys some pretty admirable assets -thanks mostly to the stealthily Vanishing of her bra- she scowled attractively at Harry. "Keep it up and I'll ruin your evening!"

"Yeah, what you gonna do?" The green eyed man asked, too drunk to stop himself poking a sleeping Dragon.

"Fine!" She stomped over to Fleur, grabbed her wrist and dragged her across the room, then forced her hand into Harry's. "Shake." She commanded.

Harry gripped the French woman's hand in bemusement, and Hermione cast some spell. Cords of light became visible and Hermione smiled in triumph. "What did you do?"

"Oh, I didn't do anything. You did." She said with a terrifying smile.

"What?"

Albus came over on unsteady legs, squinted, then declared "Congratulations!"

"Je ne te comprend pas" Fleur voiced her confusion.

"I thought so, ever since you told me the full story." Hermione said smugly. "You interrupted a magical wedding. And Magic is all about intent."

"Ri-ight." Harry drew out the word.

"So when you said the Vows Harry, I suspected you really meant them. Intending to take the woman you love as your bride." The evil schoolgirl said with a smile "And she did the same, really wanting to marry the boy with those mischievous eyes… even if he did look like Malfoy."

"…"

"Sorry, what exactly are you saying to me?" Harry asked.

"Well Harry, Fleur…" Hermione started, fulfilling her promise to ruin his evening. "…allow me to be the second to congratulate you both on your marriage."

…

"What?"

"…"

"…"

"She's not my wife!"

"He's not my husband!"

Harry and Fleur screamed together at the exact same moment.

"…"

Mrs. Potter and Mr. Delacour looked at one another for an instant. At the same time as Sirius, Tam, Hermione, and surprisingly Lily, all said together "This is going to be so much fun."

||

"Somebody set of a Nuclear Weapon on Our Island!" Elizabeth Windsor, Defender of the Faith, Queen of England bellowed at the top of her lungs late the next day. "Who?"

"Their Minister has informed me it was one of their more … prominent …citizens." The Prime Minister of Great Britain replied over the phone.

"Bring him too me." The enraged monarch ordered. "Right this instant!"

There was a long pause, some muttering, and what was clearly a muffled conversation containing more than a little heat.

"They are asking whether or not we have Zeppelin access."

||

Luna-Seven was the only one not covered by a Cloak of Invisibility, having had the foresight to place the Hallow behind a rock for Harry to find once this was all over. Metal Seal lit up in a bright flash of yellow, Water Seal in blue, Wood Seal in green, and Lunas Two through Five vanished as she had when back when she'd been in their position.

Luna-Six would stay until the end though. A blinding multitude of spectral colours, the Core Foci necessary for this most powerful of weapons. It looked pretty damn impressive Luna-Seven realised with surprise.

Ten seconds.

Luna-Seven winked at her younger self and began chanting:

"Ni Ta Ma De. Tian Xia Suo You De Ren Dou Gai Si"

The instant she cast and her magic physically touched that of her other selves she Paradoxed. Her Time-Turner exploded outward with tremendous force, and the universe ripped open in a gaping blackness of infinite depth. Tentacles wrapped around arms legs and torso, and Luna was yanked from creation in less than a moment.

Luna-Six was watching this with wide, surprised eyes, and visibly forced herself to spin-back the moment 'All Under Heaven' was completed. Luna-Seven offered the slight contented smile which had so confused her for the last sixty minutes, and she finally realised why she was wearing it.

As the blonde left this world, Helga Apparated directly into the centre of the septagram, her eyes bulged and Luna caught the look of fear just before the Founder was completely immolated.

Worth it.

Totally worth it.

The universe clenched shut its space hole, and Luna was gone forever.

||

Passing through long open roads, along motorways, and eventually down narrow suburban streets, Harry was enjoying the drive. He never took enough time to enjoy the simple things, and the soft leather and smooth ride of this luxury car definitely counted as something which needed to be enjoyed.

All too soon he stepped onto the pavement of his destination on the outskirts of Oxford once again. Strolling up to Hermione's surprisingly well warded home he ratted on the door and was whisked in by his close friend Emma, who began nattering about everything that had been going on in her life since they last met up for coffee.

Eventually Hermione's father came in and was visibly perturbed by the cosy nature of the conversation, and would later explode when he found out how regularly the two met up to chat.

Turning to the imposing man, Harry stood "Ah, Mr. Granger a pleasure as always."

The friendly smile and demeanour briefly left Hermione's father with a loss for words, but he managed an eloquent "Kgah-!"

"Now I wish this was simply a social call, however there is something quite serious I must ask you and your lovely wife." Harry went on determinedly.

"What is it Harry dear?" Emma asked with concern.

Looking the man directly in the eye with resolve, the black haired teenager said "I would like your permission to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."

','

Dan Granger was slumped on the floor of his study two hours later. The place was a mess, absolute total devastation. All of his medical journals were ripped and torn, loose pages littering the carpet, which was ripped in places itself.

The snow globe his mother Mary Granger had bought him as a souvenir from her trip to the Azores was in pieces, the tinted water it had contained staining his heavy wooden desk. His rage and desperation had shredded the photographs of his beautiful family, and they too lay scattered on the around his study.

The world was over.

His baby, his beautiful little girl, was going to marry that monster. He just knew it! Nothing he could possibly say would dissuade her once his angel made up her mind. And even Emma, his traitorous better half, was going to side against him.

God alone knew what that … person … was making his little girl do at night. A boy like him would undoubtedly have her acting in ways she would think abhorrent, and making her think it was her own idea!

Dan shuddered as his overactive imagination spiralled out of control, bringing to the forefront of his mind scene after scene of depravity. 'Hermione was always such a sweet little girl' the man thought, his hands shaking.

There was only one thing he could reasonably do to stop this. There were a few niggling problems as to the logistics, but even if he were caught it would be worth it.

Dan Granger had to kill Harry Potter.

It was the only sensible course of action. Okay, so the boy was a wizard and that made things more difficult. Nevertheless witches and wizards were still human, Hermione had said so, and they could die just like anyone else. Only well, that bastard Potter had apparently survived his death once already…

Dan almost started to cry; was there anything he could do at all?

He heard someone at the front door, and then heard the front door open, and then heard Emma call "Dan can you come downstairs for a moment, Hermione has something she would like to tell us."

Dan numbly got to his feet and went downstairs, bracing himself to hear news of the apocalypse from his daughter's lips.

When Hermione informed him that she was in a same sex relationship with a girl she'd met at school, Dan physically cried for joy. The relief was just that strong.

||

The group kicked back and relaxed for a while, throwing out a few truly awful ideas on how to defeat Voldemort, and basically needling Tam by refusing to share Hermione's animal form. Dumbledore must have been drinking before he even entered the room because he kept going on and on about utilising the power of love to take down the Dark Lord. His rationale being that thanks to all his ritualistic mutilations, Voldemort was incapable of feeling the emotion.

Fine.

Harry had in fact already defeated Voldemort once using this method, as he kept reminding the old man. Luna had almost died doing it for Merlin's sake! Nevertheless Albus wouldn't leave it alone, and kept drawing the conversation back to weaponized love being the only solution.

"I think I've had enough." Lily said, putting down her third empty glass. "I've been feeling all sickly and nauseous for days now. I don't know what's wrong with me."

"I'm telling you it's easy…" Harry said to Tam from the other side of the table, as Bellatrix fired a spell at his mother. "…You go 'Hey Flighty, doesn't Mars look really bright tonight' and then when he looks up I bash his brains in using a shovel from behind!"

"Okay, firstly that won't work." Tam commented, tossing an empty can negligently over her shoulder. "You cannot believe for one moment a shovel impact would be strong enough to harm the body he's using."

From the other side of the table Bella lets out a "Huh, blue." Before casting the same spell on herself, with the same result. Blue.

Harry frowned at his brother's comment. "I bashed his brains in with a wandlessly summoned Gravestone once. You were there at the time!"

"Yeah, but I'd been charged with collecting 'Blood of the Enemy' from you…" Tam informed "…and you'd been spending most of your energy mouthing off, talking about what a smashing idea resurrecting Voldemort was, and that you'd always wanted to make a difference in evil."

"So?"

"Think Trials. The first two bodies I created for Voldemort were incredibly weak because you didn't really see yourself as his enemy." The redhead told him as if it were obvious. "The one he's currently using has Amelia Bones' blood running through its veins, and she most certainly thought of herself as an enemy of the Dark Lord."

"Oh, yeah that makes a kind of sense." Harry admitted. "So the shovel idea is out then?"

Lily finally noticed her belly was glowing the exact shade of blue as Bellatrix. "What's going on?" She asked in confusion.

"Congratulations." The tiger animagus said happily "You're pregnant."

"I'm what?" Lily screeched.

"She's what?" Harry, Sirius, and probably a few others yelled together at the same instant.

"Pregnant." Bella repeated simply.

"How can she possibly…"

"How can I possibly…"

It was right then that Harry noticed his mother was not the only person glowing blue. About an hour's worth of sputtering ran through the Vorpal Bunny's mind over the course of the next five seconds. "But I thought Hogwarts put Contraceptive Potion in all the food?" He said aloud "Only, I'd just recovered from death, so there was none in my system." He finished to himself with a small nod.

Everyone was looking between Harry, Lily and Bellatrix. As he swiftly came to several conclusions at once, then proceeded to take them all in stride, Harry voiced "If it was you Sirius, I'm going to kick your arse!"

Fleur and Hermione were both wide eyed and spoke together "You and Bellatrix are going to have a baby?"

"Two actually." Bella threw in. "I caught pregnancy the first time Harry got re-birthed as well."

"Wait." Hermione slashed into the conversation again. "That doesn't even make sense. Harry's first re-birth was at the end of July, you'd be more than six months through by now if what you're saying is true."

"Yes." Bella agreed negligently.

"Explain." Harry stated. He didn't know how either, but something told him he was going to like it.

"Harry is always getting himself into dangerous situations, and I didn't think he'd want me dragging an unborn baby into fights when I'm protecting him." She stated as though this was obvious. Which it kind of was, and it was even true that Harry wouldn't think it a good idea.

"So you killed it?" Hermione asked appalled.

"What? No." Bella started. "I stuck it in the Squib."

"…"

Harry started laughing, a full belly laugh which caused a number of the people in the room to look at him strangely.

"The Squib?" The, as yet un-transformed, Mongoose animagus asked.

"Sh-, She's," Harry tried haltingly to get out, over his sniggering. "She's talking about Filch."

"Oh, that's funny." Tam said joining in the laughter. Spotting Hermione's glare she changed her mind "Tragic! Oh, that's so tragic. That's what I meant to say."

His mother, momentarily thrown from thoughts of her own imminent child, asked "How can a man…?"

"He won't be the first guy to take a kid to term."

"He won't?" Hermione asked incredulously.

"Hell no, it happens all the time."

"It does?"

"Yeah. Sticking kids in Squibs is pretty common too…" Sirius said. "…I highly doubt cousin Narcissa would 'defile' her body that way."

"She didn't." Bellatrix put in.

"If it's a girl we have to name it Rose." Harry said, controlling her giggles.

"Aww, but Blacks always name their children after star constellations." She pouted, fluttering her big purple eyes.

"Sorry, but I decided when I was seven that my eldest daughter would be named Rose, when I used to tend the flowers in my aunt's garden." Harry began. "And it's an Evens family tradition to name girls after flowers."

"Oh, okay Harry." She readily agreed. "So if they're boys you'll let me name them after astrological phenomenon?"

"Sure."

"Thanks Harry."

Hermione's brain had slipped into neutral gear. Harry was about to be the father of two children, despite being a year younger than she was. Somehow he didn't seem all that concerned about it, even though in her opinion, Harry was by far the most immature person in the whole world! Men can become pregnant in the magical world apparently. The kid already had a name! And Lily was pregnant too…

"So are we fighting then?" Harry asked his godfather.

"It wasn't me!" Sirius protested.

"It wasn't anyone!" Lily screamed.

"So you're carrying the second coming of Jesus?" Harry asked his mother sarcastically.

"No, the last person I had sex with was James three months ago. Erm, fifteen years ago?"

"Did you rape and Obliviate my mother Snape?" He asked pointedly "Because that really is something I'll have you tortured into insanity for!"

"I've not been Obliviated!" She attested "I'm too good at Occlumency for that."

"So, you're saying that you carried a kid through your death?" Harry asked dubiously. Thinking it through he decided that was probably possible. "Cool. I have a new brother or sister. Is it too late for Gender Forcing? I already have a brother, so can you make sure it's a girl?"

Rome
Friday the 1st of May 1998

A man of average height, with unkempt hair, and an insolent look of self-assurance on his face was escorted into a huge auditorium. Wearing a magically limiting choker around his neck and magically limiting shackles around his wrists, he was escorted by a burly Auror on each arm, and four more following close behind, wands raised threateningly to his back.

Nobody was expecting the man to attempt escape, as he had never made a single move to do so in all the time since his arrest, but he was a high profile target, and as such not the kind of person with which they would take unnecessary chances.

The room was jam packed with people. Some in attendance were richer than others, some more famous, of differing cultures, backgrounds and upbringings. Some were present for entertainment, others justice, and still more in attendance for no reason they could honestly claim to know themselves.

The man had been brought across thousands of miles to be here, the centre of magic, and the sprawling core of the world's magical government; the International Confederation of Wizards, or more commonly known by its acronym the ICW.

With dishevelled hair and cheeky look on his face still firmly in place, the man was shepherded to an imposing chair in the middle of the room, and firmly pushed down only to be locked in place by yet more magically limiting cords. The man could not help a small smile, which was witnessed by all those in attendance. A stately woman on her raised dais stood and cleared her throat before beginning to speak.

"We are gathered here today, the first of May 1998, for the sentencing of Harry James Potter for all of his numerous crimes."

','

L1 LaGrange between Beta Gabriel and its Moon, Epsilon Eridani System
Thursday the 15th of Malfoy 54'855 New Byzantine Calendar

A man far short of the average two meters was escorted into a hastily constructed Imperial Courtroom at the point of fifteen glowing plasma rifles. They'd been tracking this fucker for more than six hundred years, and were not going to let him slip through their fingers by giving him too much time to be rescued or escape on his own.

Yet they had to do it legally, so the protocol must be followed.

The bastard had a grin on his face like this whole thing was going exactly as planned, and this was unnerving the High Conciliator more than he would ever allow himself to express. Marshalling himself and looking over at the nine lesser members of the Establishment, the High Conciliator held in an apprehensive breath.

The cocky man with distinctive emerald eyes was brutally forced into the restraints of the throne-like chair in the middle of the room by a tough looking Marine with buzzcut tiger stripe hair. The Marine was heavily scared and his bulging muscles were clearly twitching in the hopes he'd get to personally strangle the man now held restrained and at their mercy.

The High Conciliator could not really fault this attitude, given the heinous nature of the crimes the man stood charged. With a deep bracing breath he stood and began to mete out some justice at long last.

"Harry James Potter, you stand accused of the following crimes against the Establishment."

','

Back in Rome, a long, long time ago.

"Eighty four counts of using the Cruciatus Curse on a fellow human being, twelve counts of the Killing Curse, and five counts of the Imperius Curse." The stately woman read off in an even voice.

"I had a Licence." Harry pointed out reasonably.

"Sixty six counts of breaching the Statute of Secrecy."

"That's what Obliviators are for."

"One hundred and eight counts of assault on Ministry Personnel, both in Great Britain and France, as well as the United States of America."

"Those were all self defence."

"Attacking the Heir of an Ancient and Noble House in broad daylight."

"He was being a jerk."

"Kidnapping the daughter of a French diplomat."

"That was a misunderstanding."

"Five times."

"Heh," Harry laughed accidently.

The stately woman paused on hearing this and glared menacingly at the shackled seventeen year old. It was difficult enough getting through the gigantic list of crimes if the boy kept making comments and rationalisations, nevermind openly showing his amusement. They weren't even halfway through the list, and the woman simply lifted the parchment to continue, attempting as she did so to ignore the cavalier attitude.

"Practicing magic of the types in direct violation of International Conventions; specifically the creation of eleven Simulacrums, and nineteen counts of ordering the application of Fiendfyre in an uncontrolled environment."

"It's just fire." He muttered "What's the big deal?"

"One count of Slavery." The woman glowered at him again.

"Bella likes being a slave!" He blurted on noticing the woman was subconsciously waiting for him to comment.

"Assassinating a citizen of the United States, and bartering the man's head with the Vampire Clans."

"He was a racist prick."

"Two counts of Grand Theft Auto, seven counts of Carjacking, nine counts of driving without a licence, nine counts of totalling law enforcement vehicles and resisting arrest."

"How was I supposed to know all cars have blind spots?"

The woman reading out all this information was forced to pause and rub her temples for a while. The boy wasn't even supposed to talk, and she wasn't allowed to authorise a gag because of his status as Head of an Ancient House. None of this was helping with her blossoming headache.

"Fifty four counts of Mugglebaiting, eighty eight counts of ordering Muggle memories to be altered by someone other than a licensed Obliviator."

"If you can do it why should you need a license?"

"One count of premeditated murder of a fourteen year old."

"What who?" Harry spluttered.

"A Miss Luna Lovegoo-"

"Oh, right, yeah okay."

"Using a child as your airship's power source."

"It was practically dead anyway."

"Crimes against the Goblin Nation; specifically the robbing of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and the forging of Valyrian Steal in direct violation of the Goblin Treaty of 1659."

Harry just smiled at those charges, stupid Goblins.

"Utilising terror tactics."

"I bought a little girl an ice cream." Harry protested. "How is that considered terror tactics?"

"You kidnapped Astoria Greengrass from her Ancestral Home!" The woman snapped. "Owling Barron Greengrass an article about which flavours of ice-cream you and his daughter enjoy most counts as terror tactics."

"Fine, I still think tutti frutti is the best though, none of that vanilla crap."

"Setting off an Atomic Bomb."

"Found out about that one did you?" Harry asked in interest. "You should probably add international arms dealing, and profiting from the proceeds of a crime to the list as well."

"Here is my personal favourite." The stern woman said, scowling at the parchment. "Negotiating a treaty with a sitting monarch without the authorisation of an elected official, member of the Confederation of Wizards, or affiliate of the Federation of Warlocks."

"Liz is cool." Harry waved it off "You know, she didn't even know of the existence of magic until Scrimgeour told her?"

"The theft of forty four children's pelvises from Midhurst Grammar School, Sussex."

"We needed Virgin Bone, the eleven year olds don't even remember it, nor the Skele Gro because we made great efforts to keep them all Stunned." Harry whispered quietly. That one actually sounded pretty bad when it was said out loud.

"Category One Necromancy. Category One!" The woman spat. "Should I call you Magister Potter?"

"No, you're good. I don't like that title."

"Causing an Exodus Class temporal explosion and risking a Daemon Incursion."

"That was an accident."

"Causing a Daemon Incursion."

"Okay, that one wasn't an accident."

"Spelling Muggle weapons in direct violation of the 1803 ICW Accords for magical practice."

"That should technically be two counts." Harry said helpfully. "I have an M2 Browning with similar charms on it."

The woman was now fighting an outright headache, the kind which pounds at the back of a person's eyes, and wouldn't be easily shifted even with Pain Relievers. Nevertheless, the list was almost complete, so she decided to just push through.

"Creating a Homunculus or Blood Anchor."

"Damn End of Line Clause, you don't expect me to get married and fire out a bunch of kids just because of some stupid family magic, do you?"

"Three counts of ordering an unborn child into a Squib without the Squib's consent."

"Heh," Harry blurted a laugh again.

"Hiring an assassin and consorting with wanted criminals."

Harry shrugged. At least he'd got the Korean his extra six hundred Galleons before being horribly murdered by the man.

"Interfering with the Hedwig Accord, and the attempted murder of one of the signatories."

"A good name that."

"And lastly, nine hundred and seventy five counts of copyright infringement."

"Each and every one of those similarities is a coincidence." He defended. "They were all my own original creations."

The woman paused and eyed him for the longest time. After a while she started to become a little unnerved by the cheerful attitude in the face of these pretty damning charges. Hundreds upon hundreds of Magicals were present for this trial, and thousands more were doubtlessly listening in on the Wireless. It would have been known as the Trial of the Century had Gellert Grindelwald's trial not happened only fifty three years ago, and so the stern woman gave herself a moment of contemplation before she finished…

"Do you have anything to say in defence of your actions?" She asked.

"It is against my policy to apologise for hilarious crimes I'm afraid." He answered.

"You are aware we are only neglecting to name you a Dark Lord at the behest of Hermione Granger?"

"I'm a Dark Lord?" Harry asked in surprise.

"Daemon Summoning and destroying an entire city at a single stroke," the stern woman prompted "those are rather emblematic Acts of Greatest Evil. Coupled this with the fact you have an Escort Guard who carries your Dark Mark."

"Oh." Harry said lamely. "I never thought of that."

"So do you have anything to say for yourself?"

"No, not really. I am actually guilty of pretty much all of those charges." He stated. "I don't feel the least bit bad about any of it either."

"As you were attempting to battle a Dark Lord at the time, and for your support of Hermione Granger in her defeat of Lord Voldemort, we will not sentence you have your soul destroyed by Dementors." The stern woman let out a long breath. "For crimes against magic, and by my authority as acting Supreme Mugwump, I hereby pronounce you to be executed by method of Killing Curse this evening of May 1st 1998."

"Ah well," Harry said with a wide smile "we all gotta go sometime."

','

Back floating in the LaGrange point of a distant Planet, a long, long time in the future.

"Stealing War Minister Ahkna's private yacht, and crashing it into a docking ring."

"How was I supposed to know it had a Footprint Engine?"

"Seducing a member of the Sisters of Chastity."

"Hey, she came onto me."

"Replacing the ozone layer Telliom-8 will a cheap substitute."

"I gave it back less than a month later… well most of it."

"Infiltration and subsequent destruction of the Peace Moon." The man scowled hatefully reading that one, the single greatest setback in the Establishment's entire history. "You even stole the Blueprints, and deleted the hard copies."

"You can't prove it though." Harry told the High Conciliator with a broad grin.

The man was visibly fighting back a truly vicious headache by this point, and the irreverence Harry was treating these incredibly serious charges with was hardly making things easy on him. It was just a shame the Compacts prevented the accused from being gagged, meaning there was nothing to be done, and so the High Conciliator simply went back to reading the charges.

"Freeing the Banik slave race."

"I lost a bet."

"Line theft. More specifically making sure one of your descendants is next in line for the throne of the Hynerian Empire."

"Little Lily wanted to be a princess." Harry put in. "It was a birthday present."

"Eighty five counts of Sedition and conspiracy to commit mayhem."

"Mayhem? Man that sounds cool."

"Impersonating a member of the Clergy."

"I was trying to talk my way out of a parking ticket."

"One count of Regicide."

"What? Who?"

"Sikozu the Viscountess of-," The man reading his list began with a snarl.

"Nevermind," Harry interrupted. "I know who you mean."

The growl he let loose would have terrified any normal person listening to it, but Harry simply waved for the overly stressed man to continue, smiling pleasantly the whole time. As the list only contained a few remaining lines the High Conciliator simply pushed to end it.

"Breaking the stockade on Harvest Colony."

"They needed power and medical supplies. I guess no good deed goes unpunished."

"Theft of the Harvest Colony Birthstone."

"Okay, so maybe it wasn't completely altruistic."

"And finally, but not least of your crimes, ten thousand and forty four counts of copyright infringement."

"Despite the similarities, all of those are coincidences." Harry told the strangely angry man, offering a firm nod to underscore his seriousness.

"In my capacity of High Conciliator I hereby pronounce you guilty of all these charges, as well as a danger to organised society." The man spoke loudly from his raised position in the Imperial Courtroom. "You do not get a last request, nor are you offered the opportunity to explain your actions …this I declare."

"This legal system seems kind of barbaric." Harry commented over the top of a gavel's thumping.

"You are sentenced to death by firing squad, today Thursday the 15th of Malfoy 54'855, in our station near Beta Gabriel."

The muscle bound Marines dragged him to his feet and hustled him across the room, to the far and presumably reinforced wall. Fifteen glowing Plasma Rifles were aimed at his chest and head, and just before they introduced his body to temperatures the likes of which one would find on a Saturday morning jaunt across the surface of a star, Harry spoke:

"Even after all this time I still can't believe that bastard has a month named after him."

There was a bright flaring and everything went dark.

The instant Tam's palm touched the back of Hermione's hand she shrieked in agony, like a localised Cruciatus to her right hand. Snatching it back she looked and saw atrocious burns on her palm and Hermione's eyes had gone wide at the sight. Reaching over the brunette instinctively grabbed her wrist for a better look and the unspeakable pain, fire and burning, wracked her limb.

Tam snatched the appendage back swiftly as her right hand turned to ash. Quick thinking had Tam's wand out, gripped in her left and pointing at the opposite limb. "Lacero!" the duellist Cutting Curse separated her right at the elbow, and the severed limb turned to dust not a moment later.

"What?" Hermione asked in shock.

Tam hastily cauterised the bleeding and took a step away from her girlfriend, amorous thoughts long forgotten. "J-just. Do not touch me okay."

"You are affected by the Blood Guardian." Hermione voiced the obvious realisation. Then came to an even more horrible implication, and a wide eyed question "But how are we supposed to… y'know? Stuff."

Recently amputated arm on the back burner, Tam raised an eyebrow "Stuff?" she smiled "Is that all I am to you? A means to an end, only fit for your personal enjoyment of stuff?"

"Of course not. It's just that it's been three days!" Hermione said incriminatingly.

"I have just cut off my own arm!" Tam exploded, secretly enjoying the blushing girl's reaction. "Have a little empathy Selfish Sally."

"What's going on over here?" Harry asked, walking into the Library with Bellatrix at his side. "We were about to get some lunch, you'll never guess who we ran into."

"Hermione's touch burns me…" Tam began "…I keep forgetting that the Dark Lord and I share the same magical signature, so the Blood Protection thing effects me too."

Harry's eyes lit up in glee, glittering with unfettered amusement. "Meaning that you two can't…" He made a shameless scissoring motion with his fingers, causing Hermione to blush further. "It's karma paying you both back for mocking me. Maybe you can get some rubber gloves or something. Or if you want me to do the honours?"

"Not a chance in hell Harry." His brother growled in an attempt to remain dignified. Turning to Bellatrix she asked "Would you mind helping me with some healing which is kind of out Poppy Pomfrey's league?"

Bella blinked a few times before working out what the redhead was talking about. "Yes okay, although I have not done it for years."

||

"You can't resist playing the big damn hero!" Harry-Six commented with feigned sternness.

"Oui. Are you not glad to see me 'Arry?" Fleur asked smugly from his side.

"Huh, I suppose." He admitted. "Maybe just a little anyway." Turning to his otherside Harry-Six went on with a smile. "Good to see you again Frost."

The Vampire looked more or less the same, albeit his eyes -even the whites- were churning a blood red. "Who can resist a good old fashioned Werewolf slaughter?"

Frost's hastily gathered Vampire contingent had slammed itself against the Werewolf army's flank, and was in the process of massacring them without mercy. Harry-Six had to give them bonus points for timing.

"True enough." The jade eyed teen agreed.

"Now if you will excuse me, I could use the exercise." Frost left, leaping at least twenty foot into the air.

Thick leather and motorcycle helmets. Who said Vampires were only dangerous at night?

||

"Do we know the cure for Nundu's Breath?" Harry asked, having recently taken a big lung full of the purple mist and getting kind of worried.

"We are immune to all known poisons Harry." Tam replied tiredly, bent double and attempting to catch her breath. "We're both Parselmouths, Nundu's Breath isn't a big deal."

"People who speak Parsel are immune to poison? Since when?" Harry asked, ignoring the booming otherworldly voice, and therefore missing whatever its instructions had been.

"It's a Blood Trait. Would you please not ask stupid questions Harry, I've just killed a Nundu with my bare hands, I'm a little tired." The Strengthening Ritual she'd gone through years ago was totally worth sacrificing her crappy'grass snake' animagus form, that was for sure.

"Well I killed two Nundu's with my big sword, and I'm not tired at all." Harry taunted, in his 'I'm cooler than you' voice. As a direct result of his mocking, Harry almost lost his head to the first of an army of half naked, snatching, bird creatures which were surrounding them. "Great, Harpy Ladies."

||

Hermione was absolutely disgusted by the sight. It was simply horrible, a horrible thing to be forced to watch. But like a car accident or a train wreck, she just could not look away.

Fleur Delacour was sitting on Harry Potter's knee, and feeding him his dinner, and they were looking at one another with big goofy grins.

They were of course very obviously, and very seriously, injured. Harry had some deep gashes and cuts on his face, a black eye, much bruising, and the horrifically broken nose. His arm was in a sling, and he was sitting tenderly due to the broken ribs. Fleur was in pretty much the same state, scorch marks and burns from one too many run-ins with casually tossed about fireballs, and singed hair sticking up at the back worse than Harry's.

"I think my foot is broken." Fleur said, as though the fact were of mild interest, but not really important.

"I should bloody well hope so with the number your second Foe Hammer did on my ribs." Harry responded with a pleased smile, accepting another fork-full of his Dinner.

"You two have very serious issues!" Hermione declared from her position across the table.

"Pipe down Hermione."

"Oui." Fleur agreed "It is as though you do not wish us to have any fun at all."

"How can that have possibly been fun?" The bushy haired woman asked shaking her head. "Neither of you were using anything approaching friendly magic."

The two, totally NOT married couple, stopped acting all moon-eyed and turned to gaze directly at Hermione. They wore identical looks which declared her to be crazy.

"You expect me to use kid gloves against her?"

"Do you suppose I should treat him like a child?"

The fact they both spoke the same sentiment at the same moment was not lost on her. For the first time in a long while she remembered something Luna had said beck when she'd been fourteen, in the small interval of time between Harry's funeral, and the blonde's time travel. Luna had made a comment about the two pretty much being the same person.

Hermione suddenly realised it was true. They were both insane.

London (the ridiculously distant past)
Saturday the 2nd of May 1998

"If I become a Dark Lord that means I could really go for that whole Dark Harem idea Luna came up with." Harry said to Tam as the two walked through the Ministry of Magic building side by side. They passed the security guard who seemed surprised to see them for some reason, and strolled confidently toward the lift. "And I'd even be able to kill Draco Malfoy without worrying about the ethics of the situation."

"We could take over the world I guess…" Tam hit the button for Level 2 and the doors shut with a soft 'Bong' noise, they were quite for a while listening to the ruffling of paper aeroplanes, and the redhead eventually finished. "Getting Hermione to sign off on it would be pretty difficult though."

"And ruling the world sounds like a full time job anyway." Harry pointed out.

"I suppose once we had taken over and declared ultimate victory, we could split our forces in half and fight each other." Tam mused idly.

"OOooo…" The dark haired man said "…I really like that idea. Dibs on Kamchatka."

"You want Kamchatka?" The redheaded woman asked in surprise. "Not the United States or China?"

"Nar, you can have the big countries, I'll take Guam and still win."

"Hmm."

"We could sell it as a 'Benevolent Plan of World Optimisation,' Hermione might go for that."

"Maybe." Tam allowed with a shrug. "We have Luna to rescue and my heist to complete first though."

The doors of the lift opened slowly and the two walked through several corridors and into the large Chamber which was used for Wizengamot sessions, twin Senating Beards firmly in place. The room was filled with the other forty nine Lords, Ladies, Barons, and Baronesses, the Chief Warlock, and basically everyone who held a vote in the legislative branch of the British Magical government.

"You're dead!" One of the Wizengamot members shouted from his seat, the same man which always seemed to talk first and force Harry to get on with whatever he was about.

"Who the hell are you anyway?" Harry asked "You are the only member of this organisation who ever seems to talk."

"That's Baron Parkinson Harry." Padfoot shouted from his seat on the other side of the room.

"Really?" He said in surprise. "Hey, I know your daughter."

"I am aware of that."

"She doesn't like me very much."

"No she does not." Parkinson agreed. "Doesn't change the fact you are supposed to be dead."

"Actually, the ICW was careless enough to sentence me to be hit with a Killing Curse." Harry told him with a smirk. "And being as I am, the sexy Boy-Who-Lived, I am immune to that curse." There was some grumbling, and outright hostility but Harry pressed on. "Even better, I can't be charged for the same crimes twice, so there is nothing anyone can do about it. HA!"

What a fucking great plan, even if Harry said so himself. There had been some rumours saying Harry Potter could survive his death, but they were just that; rumour. Only twelve people actually knew about the Rebirths, everyone else simply assumed he'd been injured and healed. Or, in the case of the public Funeral back in 1996, they believed Harry to have faked his death as part of some deep plan or other. Pretending immunity to the Avada Kedavra curse was more or less believable also, due to the stories bandied about in his youth describing Harry Potter as a super hero.

"So what are we voting on today?" Harry asked the Wizengamot with an irritating smile perfectly reminiscent of Gilderoy Lockheart.

||

Hermione was shuffling her feet. This was all incredibly fascinating of course, and it had been an ever so long day. Duelling Voldemort, having people call her the greatest witch of the age, the aftermath. And then Harry attempting to vanquish the Dark Lord for good using a strange Chinese meal.

But none of that was the most important thing.

No, they were in this, until recently unknown Ritual Room on Harry's floating home, and there was no longer any pressing need to do anything. The day was over, and any glares or incriminations could obviously wait until another time.

And well, Tam was all naked and sweaty. And they could touch again. After weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks, of not being able to get touched by Tam.

Okay, so maybe her thoughts were running a little wild, but that was clearly the important part about this wasn't it? It had been weeks, WEEKS!

"Oh for heaven sake." Harry blurted. "We can talk about this tomorrow Tam, Hermione looks like she's about to explode."

Shifting her weight from foot to foot, Hermione blushed, but refused to lower her gaze as her girlfriend turned big brown eyes on her. Tam was just looking at her for a while without expression, and she blushed a little harder.

"You are absolutely correct Harry." She said. Carefully making her way over to Hermione, Tam lightly brushed the smallest finger of her left hand against the brunette's cheek. Noting the lack of screaming or fire, she concluded the Blood Protection had been blessedly neutralised. "Goodnight all."

Then Hermione was lifted off her feet and over Tam's surprisingly strong shoulders.

The two women left the room without another word.

||

'That is it, I quit!' The redhead thought to itself resolutely. Pettegrew had come in hefting the corpse of Voldemort through the antechamber of what was currently their primary fortification. It was bad enough that the Master had decided to make the Manor House of his Muggle father the central hub of his organisation, but from the obvious deadness of his latest body it did not take a genius to figure out what had probably happened.

This was something which had been eating at 'it' ever since the spring solstice and the Master's first two rebirths. He was clearly in command of immensely powerful magic, and had equally formidable skill when utilising it. So how in the name of Circe herself could the man keep getting himself killed? It made no sense at all.

||

Tam shook her head and left the room in search of Bellatrix, while Hermione went on a long rant about none existent creatures. Eventually the blonde voiced a total non sequitur throwing her through a loop. "You seem tense, when was the last time you had sex with Harry?"

Hermione's eyes bulged and after a little spluttering said "What? I've never. We're just friends Luna."

"What does that have to with anything? Harry and I are friends, yet we have sex all the time." The older girl couldn't respond to this in any kind of intelligent way, and Luna's jaw dropped open in feigned realisation "You mean to tell me that you have joined Harry's Dark Harem, but you haven't taken advantage of all the free sex?"

"I HAVE NOT JOINED A DARK HAREM!" Hermione screamed in outrage.

"Of course you have. Do you really think it's a coincidence that, Sirius aside, all the members of our Dark Army are hot girls?"

With a final screech the bushy haired girl span and legged it from the Room of Requirement, having completely forgotten what she had been meaning to do that evening.

As soon as the door swung shut Harry let out a full belly laugh. "Do you think she's ever going to figure out you're just messing with her?" He asked

Wrinkling her nose Luna said "This from the guy who held a loud conversation where he could be overheard, talking about how his airship was going run on Orphan Blood Biodiesel."

"Come on, its cheep and renewable. How could Hermione come to the conclusion that I'm going evil if I'm so concerned about the environment?" Luna stuck out her tongue "You know, maybe one day I'll just tell her that a Crumple-Horned Snorkack is a silly sounding name for a cousin species of Unicorn which is thought to be extinct."

"Snorkacks did occasionally kill and eat the people they found, but do you honestly believe that telling her would be enough of a hint though?" she asked "I mean, we go to a school of magic, Britain's national sport is played flying around on line segments, and the poor girl still thinks these things are anything but crazy."

||

Wearing one of those 'Support Harry Potter: Everyone Else Stinks!' badges from fourth year, Harry stepped into the Headmaster's Office. It was time to get through this.

||

"Sevie me old mate, guess which emerald eyed favourite student of yours got an 'Outstanding' in his Potions O.W.L." Harry went on happily "I'll give you a clue, he got exactly the same score as one Lily Evens back when she was a fifth year."

"Potter I-" Snape began in barely restrained fury.

"Of course full credit goes to your teaching style Professor," he continued in the attempt to be as infuriating as possible "the calm and pleasant instruction really allows any student to reach his or her full potential."

The overt hatred being directed toward the dark haired sixteen year old should have been worrisome in the extreme, but was not the Hogwarts motto something about how much fun could come from poking a sleeping Dragon?

"Besides Potions is a doddle isn't it? It's just like cooking, and when in doubt add Eye of Newt." Harry asserted with wide eyed innocence. "Seriously, Eye of Newt is the answer to like everything … with enough Newt Eyes a person could cure death itself!"

There was one class other than Arithmancy which Harry attended without fail, and would not ditch unless he had very good reasons for doing so. And that class was Potions.

Potions was ever so much fun.

It took Professor Snape almost half the lesson to regain his composure and begin teaching again. Harry had been channelling his inner Dumbledore, pretending that the Professor was very young, and that he was the benign grandfatherly figure Snape had been missing his whole life. He'd been doing it consistently since half way through Fourth Year, with the goal being to cause a stroke before Graduation.

||

The two stood watching a hyperactive Lovegood in bemused silence until Hermione came up behind them and asked "What did you do to her Harry?"

Glancing over his shoulder he defended "Well, you know how I used the Hot Sauce when I fully opened my Occlumency Barriers, and forced that sensation through my weird Horcrux connection with Voldemort?" Harry asked as a yellow rocket flew between the group to resume her plan which may or may not be about Vampires.

Tying her hair back from the wind Hermione responded "Yes, and apparently the Dark Lord has an incredibly low tolerance for spicy foods, so it almost killed him. What does that have to do with what you have done to Luna?"

"You know how I've been sleeping with Tracy on and off since last year?" Harry said "Well some of those times, the Polyjuice would wear off half way through, and she would turn out to really be Luna." His bushy haired friend didn't really know how to take this news and Harry just went on "Not that I really mind of course, the girl is actually smoking hot...

...Anyway, following your idea to use the mindlink connection, we decided that because magic was based on intent, forcing the sensations of sex through the link was sure to do a number on Voldemort. The theory being that it is the opposite of pain, which seems to be all I ever feel from him."

Hermione massaged her temples, but refused to comment on how that was not in any way her suggestion. "So you used sex. Okay fine, but how does that explain all of this..." she gestured around the detritus and scribblings, not to mention the hyperactive fourth year.

Harry got a little uncomfortable and brushed his hand through his hair before answering "Well you see, every now and then she would start making this mewing keening sound, and then her eyes would roll up in her head and she would black out...

...only, you all said that it was important that the Dark Lord be distracted all day. As a result I kind of kept casting 'Rennervate' each time she tensed up and lost consciousness. You know, so that we could keep going." He blurted that last out quickly in the hopes that no-one would hear.

Three pairs of eyes tracked the blonde girl as she dashed about the room.

"How long were the two of you..." Hermione asked, trailing off at the end.

"About twenty hours."

Padfoot sighed "Fine, I admit it. Your animagus form is cooler than mine."

^ [shagging like bunnies]

"Okay, let me get this straight," Hermione began a few days later "everything that happened at Châteaux Delacour, happened with only a single Time-Turner."

"Yes." Harry agreed.

"I want to plot the course it travelled…" She declared, filching some parchment and a quill from the expanded satchel known as a Scholars Pack, which Albus bought her for Christmas. Three days later that same piece of parchment was covered by a large number of crisscrossing lines, scribbled notes, rubbings out, crossings out, asterisks, and people's names suffixed with numbers.

...

Bellatrix-Three had arrived at Hogwarts and warned Dumbledore of the attack. Dumbledore had then collected Sirius, Lily, Hermione, and the Time-Turner, then travelled to France leaving Tonks, Mad-Eye and Scrimgeour to defend the Castle.

Bellatrix-Three had passed on Harry's orders to Luna, telling her in turn, to track down her first self to help.

Out in the French countryside Albus, Sirius, Lily, and Hermione, all met up with Harry-Four, who ordered them all to use their Time-Turner and spin-back one hour. Then follow Legilimency obtained directions to the rendezvous room.

Dumbledore offered the Time-Turner to Harry-One once he got to the rendezvous room, and Harry-One span back one hour to think.

Harry-Two shouted about how he'd fucked up, span back becoming Harry-Three, and he went in search of Malfoy. Failing because one of Draco's bodyguards let loose Unrestrained Fiendfyre in order to escape.

Harry-Three span back with Bellatrix-One, becoming Harry-Four and Bellatrix-Two respectfully. Those two used Disillusioned animagus forms to run through the werewolves without having to get too involved, and eventually found themselves on Caerbannog. They discovered a Time-Turner and the Cloak waiting for them.

Harry-Four gave Bellatrix-Two the Time-Turner which was around his neck, and picked up the one on the floor for himself.

Bellatrix-Two span back alone five hours becoming Bellatrix-Three, then gave orders to Albus and Luna. She proceeded to place the Cloak of Invisibility and Time-Turner in the Atrium for later collection, then waited several hours and seeded one of the woods with Tam's Inferi Horde.

Harry-Four gave orders to Dumbledore and the group, before made his way back to the rendezvous room at a breakneck sprint. He drank an offered Invigoration Draught and listened to some advice about taking Hermione before entering the room. He span back with Hermione as advised, becoming Harry-Five.

Harry-Five escorted Hermione out to the Death Eater battle, and she saved Dumbledore by tagging Helga with a spell called Starfall. Once the dust settled Harry-Five performed a number of diagnostics to determine what time, and to which location, the Founder had Apparated too.

He then went in search of an Invigoration Draught, and ran into Tam-Two. Neither knew where in the timestream the other was, so spoke little to each other to prevent too much confusion.

Harry-Five offered Harry-Four the advice about taking Hermione, and gave him the Invigoration Draught. Once in the room he decided now was the time to go fight the Werewolves properly, and Tam told him the past version of herself was outside.

Harry-Five took Dumbledore, Lily, Sirius, and Tam, then span them all back one hour. Becoming as he did so, Harry-Six.

Dumbledore went North alone, and the rest went East. Harry-Six and the group were rescued in the nick of time by Fleur and her Vampire Army. Harry-Six got into a fight with Godric, ending up with his grizzly incapacitation.

Tam-One revived him in the rendezvous room using Legilimency and Healing Supplies. And he span back his final hour, becoming Harry-Seven.

Harry-Seven kissed Fleur and sent her back a full six hours. She travelled to the United States, met with Deacon Frost, and negotiated an Army. It wasn't all that hard, Frost had met her before, and he liked Harry.

Fleur and the Vampires then saved Harry-Six and his crew from the Werewolves.

Tam-One took Fleur's Time-Turner, transfigured the unconscious Harry-Six into a coin, and then legged it back to the rendezvous room. She stowed him in a plant pot, then span back one hour to rest and obtain Healing Supplies. Becoming as she did Tam-Two.

Tam-Two ran into Harry-Five who was searching for an Invigoration Draught, but neither spoke much in order to prevent too much confusion.

Tam-Two made it back to the rendezvous room, wrote her previous self a message to go wait outside, and used the Healing Supplies as well as Legilimency to revive Harry-Six. After a while everyone left, and Tam-Two offered the Time-Turner to Luna-One.

Luna-One escorted Tam-Two from the room along with Lunas-Two through Six. Following a ten minute wait she followed her eldest self to the location Helga would supposedly appear, covered by the Invisibility Cloak.

Luna-One set her single element Earth Seal and channelled much magic through it, before spinning back one hour and becoming Luna-Two.

Luna-Two played a little table tennis but eventually did the same, only with a single element Fire Seal instead.

Luna-Three did the same only with a single element Metal Seal.

Luna-Four did the same only with a single element Water Seal.

Luna-Five did the same only with a single element Wood Seal.

Luna-Six did something similar, only without the table tennis, and it was with a finicky five elemental Core Foci. She then caught a glimpse of what was going to happen to her final analogue. Spotting the tentacles wrapping themselves around arms, legs and torso, then dragging her into a gaping void. Luna-Six kept her head and span back her final hour, becoming Luna-Seven.

Luna-Seven noticed right away that the Time-Turner was spinning like mad, and glowing starbright white. She and Harry-Seven had a conversation in the rendezvous room, and eventually she found herself incanting 'All Under Heaven.'

The instant Luna-Seven's magic touched her previous analogues' magic, the Time-Turner exploded.

And all of this, from wedding to rendezvous room to Helga's death, happened within the span of about ninety minutes of sidereal time, from a Châteaux Delacour bystander's point of view.

…

"Wow," Harry said reading Hermione's completed notes "that is indeed very complicated."

"You've read the letter from the Department of Mysteries: Time Subdivision?" His brunette friend asked.

"The one filled with more swearwords than any professional letter has any right to contain?" Hermione nodded. "Yeah I have. Those pansies don't know the first thing about time travel!"

||

It hadn't really been the storybook mother-son reunion everybody kind of assumed it would be. And worse was that every man, woman, man trapped in a woman's body, and dog-man, had universally agreed that each and every one of those heartwarming fairytale moments were ruined by Harry himself.

They'd unanimously concurred it was Harry's fault. And each time the two were about to have some kind of big emotional connection, he'd do something to weird out the whole situation, thereby spoiling everything.

First things first; one of the opening questions an orphan asks his recently revived mother, apparently shouldn't be whether or not she liked his boots. Second thing he'd learned was that when a newly resurrected maternal figure walked into a room which contained her, now fully grown son, going at it hammer and tongs with one of his friends under Polyjuice…

…and that said Polyjuice was charged with the previously mentioned maternal figure's hair. It would cause a situation which could be considered quite …awkward.

Yeah.

The excuse that he had a thing for redheads hadn't really gone down too well either.

||

"Wakey, wakey Harry Potter, how have you enjoyed our hospitality?" Clarity, sweet clarity. For the first time in what felt like years Harry's mind was his own. Looking left and right he found himself tied to a gravestone and from the light it had either just gone dawn or was about to turn to dusk. "You have been with us for eighteen days Harry Potter, surely we have made some impression on you by now?"

"Well, if it's feedback your organisation desires I'd be inclined to say something along the lines of; while the accommodations were first rate the room service was terrible."

Had the dark haired boy not had bigger problems he would have noticed the ragged, singed, and torn nature of his clothing, and the fact that he stank to high heaven. His pretty red haired captor clearly didn't hold Harry's personal hygiene or appearance in high regard.

"Amusing... as always Harry." She then stabbed him.

"Ouch... So anyway, what have you been doing with yourself Ginny? Personally I've been spending most of my time trying to get into an attractive French girl's panties." 'Whatever she has tied me to this gravestone with is tough, I wish I had my wand.'

Harry noticed a man with dirty blonde hair and watched as he sliced off his arm and throw it into a cauldron. 'Riiight, that was totally gross.' Soon after, the girl moved over to the man, being careful not to lose any of Harry's blood from the tip of the knife.

"I have been quite well Harry, studying up on my history for the most part. And of course spending time with my disembodied Lord and Master."

"Sounds like a blast. Any chance of me getting my Holly wand back, it kind of has sentimental value to me?" A dazzling smile from the well developed thirteen year old was accompanied by a shaking of her head which signalled the negative "Shame... Soooo, we're resurrecting Voldemort then? I've always wanted to take the Dark Mark, really get a chance to make a difference in evil y'know."

Finally allowing Harry's blood to drip from the knife blade into some kind of massive cauldron, she didn't reply, and a short time later the potion was finished and the smoke cleared. Harry found himself treated to a full frontal of the re-bodied Dark Lord. A little more than he really wanted to see, and a little less than he'd actually expected to see "Not a fan of the ladies I'm guessing?"

He ignored this and started on the brief history of Tom Riddle. 'Ah monologuing, it's a classic. Hell who am I kidding, I'd totally be doing the same thing if I was a Dark Lord.' Voldemort stopped short and looked up at Harry "That got through my Occlumency barriers didn't it?"

"Indeed."

"Would you by any chance like to explain all of your plans to me?" Harry asked hopefully.

The two stared at one another for a long time, Harry's skill at mind magics at this point was well up to the task of defending against a Legilimency attack without an incantation. "I think it is best I kill you now, rather than make sport of the occasion."

The redhead looked up at this confused and Harry countered "Probably for the best, I'm way more powerful than you anyway."

The last was said right when Lord Voldemort's Inner Circle Apparated in to the graveyard. 'They heard that Flighty, what are you gonna do?' Harry allowed the taunt through his shields.

"Untie him and give him back his wand."

'You're going to lose.' Harry thought in a sing songy voice. "You know, if you'd let me Cruciate and then murder Lucius Malfoy I would have probably joined you guys."

The Inner Circle found this statement uncomfortable and began shifting their collective weight as Harry was handed the Horntail wand once used by Sirius' grandfather.

"Avada Kedavra, Bumblebee."

The onrushing death magic which spewed out from twelve and a quarter inches of Elm was used solely as a distraction. A wandlessly summoned gravestone impacted brutally with the back of Voldemort's head, viciously stoving in the man's newly physical brains. With a whispered activation phrase to his wrist, Harry portkeyed to the Headmasters Office.

||

"Why is the new Sorting Hat singing in an unconvincing scouse accent?" Harry asked in dismay from his position slouched at Slytherin table.

"It was the best we could do." Hermione responded "The Headmaster and I successfully made five, and that was the best one."

"What about the other four?"

"Well, two of them just Sorted everybody into Hufflepuff," she replied "and one of them spoke Spanish on par with your French."

Ignoring her obvious jealousy when it came to his awe inspiring command of the French language Harry gestured for his wavy haired friend to finish, prompting "And the fifth?"

"Had something of an angry personality." Hermione answered wearily. "It upset Bellatrix and she torched it with Fiendfyre."

"Oh" was all he said, concluding that Bella probably had a good reason.

As Harry drifted off watching the Sorting, Hermione was deep in contemplation. Following the meeting a week prior with her nice, and surprisingly accepting parents, she and Tam had come to an agreement. Tam had eventually agreed not to do too much evil, promised not to ever put her under the Imperius Curse, and that she would never make Hermione do anything she really didn't want to do.

Hermione couldn't exactly shake the feeling that the redhead found her demands amusing, and was carefully repressing the emotion when the two had talked. Nevertheless she had agreed, and now Hermione believed she could keep the other girl in line for the most part, by simple force of will. That she could fight whatever nefarious influence the other girl seemed to have over her.

So long as the redhead did not find herself in some kind of position of power over her, Hermione considered herself level headed enough to avoid getting too caught up in things. Providing everything at Hogwarts went on as it had been for the last week of the Summer, things should settle into a more stable pattern over the coming year. That was as long as the status quo remained the same at any rate.

"…and introducing this year's Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor; Professor Tamsyn Riddle."

"Son of a bitch!" Hermione uncharacteristically swore loudly.

The Caravel of Caerbannog's crew currently consisted of only seven people; Harry was the Captain, and Bellatrix his first mate because she was the only one willing to wear the pirate costume. Hermione and Tam both flatly refused so they were relegated to swabbing the decks, a pastime Harry was unsure as to neither the purpose nor the methodology. Sirius was map-guy, or as he preferred to call himself Cartographer or Navigator pretty much interchangeably. And Tonks was Quartermaster, mostly in charge of ensure a healthy blood alcohol level for the rest of the crew.

Fleur for whatever reason protested her obvious designation of ship's Buxom Wench, but as she refused to wear the totally not trampish costume either, Harry ignored her remonstrations.</pre>

<pre>Elsewhere, watching stealthily, were two sixth year girls. Tracey had just left in the opposite direction, while Harry stood there watching her go. They took this as their cue to leave.

"You see what I mean?" said one. She tapped herself on the head with her wand, dispelling the Disillusionment Charm. "And I'm still getting over how you can cast that..."

"It's not as hard as it sounds, you know - "

"Hermione."

"Daphne. See how clever I am, saying names like you are?" Hermione chuckled as she dispelled the charm on herself. "Now really, why did we just spy on your best friend?"

"I just want support that I'm not going crazy."

"Daphne, just because she asked to get lunch with him somewhere other than the Great Hall doesn't mean that she fancies him," Hermione said patiently, shaking her head.

"So the fact that she moans his name in her sleep doesn't mean anything?"

Hermione froze, looking at the Slytherin in shock. Daphne was just laughing at her expression.

"Oh you..." She continued down the corridor with a huff. Daphne trailing behind her.

"Why do you think she's been avoiding him recently?" she pressed. "She positively fled from him on the train. I don't think she could hold it together at the time. It's actually pretty cute."

"She's been avoiding him?" Hermione asked.

"Well, she's been spending a lot more time in the common room this year and..." she broke off at Hermione rolling her eyes. "What?"

"You should be a detective, you know that?"

"Oh, shut up. Don't you get it?" Daphne said impatiently. "Harry likes me. Tracey likes him. I-"

"Like Tracey?"

" - want to hurt you."

"So they make the food along the edges and in other connecting rooms and send it... up?" Tracey asked, having only half paid attention to the conversation between Harry and the house elf. The tables were becoming more and more packed with food as the house elves continued to pile it on.

"Got it in one," said Harry. "So no one in Slytherin has bragged about being there? Seems like something someone would do."

"Most Slytherins stay in the common room because we're more comfortable there. You know how it is in this place," the girl said.

"I suppose so," Harry shrugged. "We can't all have a Fred and George in our Houses."

"People would be pranked so much they'd end up calling it Hogwarts School of Mischief and Misery," Tracey joked.</pre>

<pre>Of course, as heroic as his actions might have seemed, he still got detention until the end of the year. It was only for an hour though, and writing lines, among other menial tasks, was a decent break before he went and trained until he went to bed. He could tell that McGonagall wasn't actually angry at him for what he did. Besides, writing 'I will not threaten to destroy a House just because they deserve it,' was one of the most entertaining punishments he'd ever had.</pre>

<pre>"Blood bags are mostly harmless, especially the cast offs we get supplied with. We just got our supply line established." Eliza said off hand to no one in particular. "Of course you have to keep it refrigerated otherwise it can dry up."

Leah spoke up with a roll of her eyes, "Yeah, my fridge is now full of blood bags. Seth about fell over when he went looking for a beer."

"It was a bit startling. My six pack was wedged between two blood bags and a carton of milk." Seth said with a slight cringe.

||

They didn't bother with helmets, as they sped off deeper in to the Reservation toward the residential area. It took Eliza a second to realize that no one was going to care because it was probably common to see Leah and the Pack ignore the usual safety laws, since most of the Reservation was used to the presence of their supernatural protectors. That thought didn't even cross Leah's mind, since she knew that they weren't in danger of being pulled over. Seth was Reservation police, and he learned his lesson the last time he tried to pull her over as a prank. Jacob and Tekali yelled at them both for an hour because they'd damaged the police car in the ensuing squabble, though that had been years and years ago.

||

It was Rosalie that jumped in first. "We need to get ourselves a house. As much… fun… as roughing it might be. I have to admit I'm partial to warm showers and clean rooms."

"Which leads us to a bigger problem, money to pay for that. Since Aro knows we survived, I have no doubt that one of his first actions was to cut us off from any and all account access to the Volturi trust." Isabella said.

Emmett burst out laughing at that, and there was smiles from most of the Cullen's. Alice was the one that spoke up, giving Isabella's hand a gentle squeeze, amusement on her face. "Money is not a problem at all. We've got plenty of it to suffice."

"If by plenty, you mean assets that rival the GDP of some large countries, then sure… plenty." Adara snorted and shook her head.

Isabella raised her eyebrow and couldn't stop the small smile that crossed her face. "That's good, because all we have is the clothes on our backs and even those are borrowed."

Adara nodded. "Also, although though none of us have Esme's artistic flair when it comes to architecture, between Emmett, Rosalie, Jasper, and myself we know enough about building to construct a house that would be more than adequate. Hell we can do it faster and better than any contractor you could hire."

"Not to mention the fact that they will just use insulation in the walls instead of high explosives. That gives them a leg up right there." Eliza deadpanned. Everyone laughed, even Isabella chuckled a little.

||

Alice found herself lost in Isabella's eyes and all of a sudden felt a an uncontrollable urge to express her deepest and most desperate truth, and without conscious control her mouth began to move around the words that were irrevocable.

"I love you." The gentle lilting of Alice's voice couldn't been more unexpected. Even Alice didn't quite know how to absorb her own declaration.

||

The girl sighed a little bit and snapped the book she was reading shut with a thud, muttering under her breath. "Never liked how it finished anyway. Always thought Harry should've ended up with Hermione. Ron's such a twit." The girl sighed again and looked up into the grey sky for a moment.

||

Eliza spoke up. "The Swan Coven doesn't abandon its own."

"Swan Coven?" Isabella raised an eyebrow at her daughter. "Since when…"

"Oh please, " Eliza interrupted. "The Cullen's are already the Olympic coven. I refuse to share a name, and I refuse to be called the 'Forks Coven'. Beyond the fact that it's a stupid name, consider the sheer amount of silverware jokes and one-liners I could make out of it, we'd be totally ridiculous. I'd lose it the first time someone asks us if there's a Spoon's coven. Of course the name 'Goddess Eliza Coven' is available I'm certain…."

||

When she finally did respond, her voice was calm and deliberate. "The Volturi would have found out about our survival eventually. Now they know for sure. I… we…" She faltered a little, her next few words held huge implications. It wasn't as if she was hesitant about her intentions, but something in the way all those eyes were looking at her managed to unnerve her a bit. She was used to being stared at in fear or anger, but being stared at in expectation was a new experience. She took a second to gather herself, squaring her shoulders before she scanned the faces of everyone once again. There were frowns all around, as her voice turned cold, and her eyes slowly turned black for all to see, "The Swan Coven is declaring war on the Volturi."

||

Esme's voice turned even harder, "I think I understand now. The reason you would never turn someone, and your claims that none of us have a soul, is because of you lack one. You're a monster, reprehensible, despicable, evil. What you could never understand, was that being a vampire doesn't make you a monster by taking your soul. You have to let yourself become a monster. Although I think you always were one... Carlisle should've let you die on that hospital bed." She clenched her jaw, and any remaining kindness as well as all doubt vanished from her face, and she squeezed the foot pressed below his chin, and began placing extreme pressure on his neck.

Edward's eyes widened, as he realized what was about to happen. But part of him still felt she couldn't be serious. That she couldn't go through with this. As the pressure increased on his neck, he realized that maybe… just maybe he'd underestimated Esme. His last thought was that it didn't matter. He'd be put back together eventually. If she didn't do it, Carlisle would. Carlisle loved his eldest son, more than any of the others, and Edward believed he'd save him.

Esme was knew it was too late to do anything else. She was implacable. She had to do this. There was no other option. Edward had made his choice, and his manipulations had caused her family far too much pain to forgive. He didn't even show a remote understanding of what was wrong with his actions, nor the barest hint of remorse. Just a glimmer of self doubt and she wouldn't have been able to go through with it. Instead she found that he was absolutely convinced he was right. He would continue to be a danger to the rest of her family.

No matter how much it hurt her, no matter how much it tore her apart. She could not allow him to live.

||

Isabella wondered what happened. This Alice was so completely different. This Alice was depressed and withdrawn. Isabella was certain of one thing, she was hurting, the type of hurt that takes years to fester and grow. The old Alice seemed to embrace life with an energy and excitement that was unparalleled and hard not to take part in. This Alice barely seemed to care. What was also shocking to her, a bolt from nowhere, for just an instant, just a millisecond was Isabella wondering what could be done about it, before she forcibly thrust that thought from her mind. But it was Alice's eyes that struck Isabella the most. There was something off, and hauntingly familiar about them.

Isabella chewed on her bottom lip as she considered, trying to put her finger on what it was that bothered her so much about it all, before she realized that she had seen Alice's utterly apathetic, resigned expression only two times before in her life. When it clicked in her head, she was shocked she hadn't realized it earlier. She saw that same expression in the eyes of Marcus Volturi, though it extended to his face and voice as well. She mentally speculated whether Marcus had been that way before his wife, Didyme, was murdered.

||

Eliza waited a few moments and felt her mother draw on her power, cloaking herself. With them this close she was barely conscious of it, and it didn't distract her or hurt her in the slightest. She waited until she heard the first movements in the distant underbrush before she lit a match and set the straw of the broom on fire. Eliza then stood there with it burning, holding it out in front of her like a staff.

"What on earth are you doing?" Isabella's thoughts echoed in her daughter's mind.

"Re-enacting a classic." Eliza responded holding the broom up as figures emerged from the forest. The group stopped when they came across this odd sight.

Eliza watched them silently as the group's numbers swelled behind him. The leader smirked and began to stride forward again, his group right behind him. "This would be so much more effective if I were wearing grey instead of black."

Eliza waited until she thought most, or all of the group had entered the clearing. Then she lifted the broom above her head with her arms spread wide and shouted with a voice that could probably be heard for a mile. "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" and cracked the end of the broom down in front of her for emphasis.

"Oh you have got to be fucking kidding me…" Eliza heard her mother's reaction and couldn't help but smile. However, it had the desired effect. The advancing group stopped in surprise. There were several bewildered looks. None of the approaching mob seemed to know what to make of the seemingly crazy vampire wielding a burning broom.</pre>

<pre>"Welcome to the Ministry Magic," said the pleasant female voice, filling the box as if the woman were standing beside him. "Please state your name and reason for visit."

Honestly, this damn thing…

"James Bond, Queen's business," said Harry sarcastically. As if it really mattered at this point. It was really just a formality to help the security at the front. A few seconds later a badge dropped into the return change slot. When he picked it up he took a glance at it before doing a double take.

"Welcome back, Double-o-seven," said the female voice again as pavement rose up on all sides of him, eventually enveloping him in darkness. He could definitely detect a distinct tone of amusement.

"You're not a recording are you?" he deadpanned into the receiver after a moment of silence. The golden beam of light was now making its way up his body, illuminating the box.

"Not quite."

"…"

"…"

Ding.

"The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening."

"I'll bet you do…"

The atrium was deserted. Even the security desk was empty, the metal detector-like scanners lifeless.

"Did they do this?" he wondered aloud. Was the Ministry always this shut down at this hour? He couldn't sense a single person on the floor. Hopefully no one had been killed or otherwise. Harry made his way to the back where the elevators were and got on the first one that opened for him.

"Department of Mysteries," he said.

"Of course, Double-o-seven," came the female voice from earlier, moments after followed by the elevator moving downwards.

"I sincerely hope that you're not some consciousness that developed on its own in a building," Harry said dryly. "One is enough in my life I think."

"How unfortunate, sounds like you're spoken for."

"I am not about to flirt with a building."

"Something tells me you already have."

"I—"

"Ninth floor, Department of Mysteries," she said smoothly, overriding him as the elevator came to a stop.

"I swear, this stuff only happens to me," he muttered, leaving the elevator.

"Well, you're right about that."</pre>

<pre>Harry re-entered the room, set the bag on the floor, opened it up, and yelled, "Accio books!"

On second thought, using that specific incantation was a bad idea ... a very bad idea. If Hermione had been present, she would have scolded him for being a dim-witted idiot. Summoning books from an extremely large room where students had been hiding their stuff for a thousand years?

Bad. Idea.

A quarter of the room seemed to be flying towards him. The light from the ceiling diminished due to the onslaught of books that was coming his way. Harry had a knack for summarising situations like these. So, he did.

"Oh, crap!"

He jumped out of the way and lay on the floor, covering his face. Five minutes passed before the light in the room returned to normal. He turned around carefully and saw most of the books had made their way into the bag. He stood up, dusted himself off, and tossed a few stray books into the bag.

Harry took a peek and noticed the bag still had loads of space for other items. So without jump-starting his brain, he yelled out his next genius incantation. "Accio training stuff!"

He really should have seen this coming. Beyond manuscripts, armours, and other useful and harmless equipment ... there were also swords, flails, and other vicious weapons heading his way. This was the kind of equipment that could chop him into little pieces and thus kill him, unless he got his arse out of the way.

Harry ran the hell out of that room. He opened the door and stepped out of the path of incoming destruction. He made certain the door stayed open to ensure the spell wouldn't break. Only then did he see the people standing in the corridor. Malfoy, looking awfully smug, had fetched Snape.

"Detent –"

A suit of armour hit Snape, which caused him to drop his wand.

"Murgl –"

Snape looked at the 'few items' that missed the open bag and continued their path towards him. His eyes opened in shock. Harry wasn't certain, but he thought he heard Snape whimpering, "Mommy."

A flail hit the armour. Harry winced ... if that armour hadn't been there ...

A club hit Malfoy, who did not have anything protecting him. Harry, out of sheer reaction, winced again and held his free hand in front of his own privates.

By the time the stream of equipment trickled to a halt, Harry felt pity for them. Well, a bit of pity. Not enough to actively help them. He could have closed the door whenever he wanted, but the choice between training and them was ... not really a choice.</pre>

<pre>Professor McGonagall groaned, her head in her hands. "Harry, you are not allowed to beg Slytherins to curse your food anymore."

Harry was showing annoyance at the general situation. "Meh."

She looked up at the boy. "Stop pouting."

Harry was most certainly not pouting.

She stabbed her wand at the glass dome holding back the purple and black salad that seemed to be trying to escape. "Mr. Potter, your food does unusual things BEFORE it gets cursed by 7 years of students."

Harry could have handled it.

Apparently she could read his expression, because she looked even more exasperated. "Mr. Potter... Harry." She leaned down to his level. "Please, as a favor to me, stop adding curses when your food gains sentience."

Harry didn't know that word.

She sighed. "When it tries to talk. Or eat other students. Or move at all, really."

His frown was epic. "Well excuse me. I was unaware deliciousness was against the rules."

In all honesty, Ravenclaw would have probably lost a ton of points if Professor Flitwick had not been so gleefully examining what had once been Harry's leftover onions, which had began negotiations with the pickle capital of the east.</pre>

<pre>Amelia sighed as well and sat down in one of the chairs near Harry.

"Mr. Potter, I'm Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. I'm sure you've met my niece, Susan?"

"Yes I have, she's doing great in the D.A. and her spell casting is wicked. She learns pretty fast and looks gorgeous as well," he answered truthfully while his eyebrows rose in shock and blushed at the end.

The hooded person sniggered and explained, "It takes a little while for the Veritaserum to wear off, even after the antidote is given Mr. Potter."

Four days later Dumbledore and Snape suddenly left from Hogwarts. All sorts of rumors went flying around at their disappearance. One even suggested that both of them were getting married. To each other.

Nobody ever said that Hogwarts' rumor-mill was always correct.

"Them getting married? That's disgusting," stated Harry.

"Detention tonight Mr. Potter, for disrespecting teachers," said a familiar voice.

The two girls on his sides immediately picked that up and went along, "But why?" "You can't give him detention!"

"Very well, you two detention as well. Do you want to break the record?" Professor Umbridge ended and she stalked off.

"I swear," said Ron who was sitting nearby, "We'll never get another D.A.-lesson with her around. It's as if she wants you three in detention for the rest of this year."

"Yeah Ron, she really is a wicked one," said Harry.

After that Hermione started with her questions again. Susan broke that off by kissing Harry again. It's not like they cared about detentions any more.</pre>

Harry frowned, having to dredge that one up, He remembered the twins using it as a prank at one point. "It's purple and it causes the drinker to breath fire."

"If I were to give you Gregory's Unctuous Unction, what would the result be?" Snape asked.

"A stay in Azkaban or a casket and gravestone for you, for attempting to make me believe you were my best friend. I do not take well to manipulations, especially those of a chemical nature." Harry replied immediately, though his eyes narrowed somewhat.</pre>

	“Buttercup,” Prim said, needing no more than the hiss to know what her sister was talking about. “He's alive.”
	Katniss closed her eyes, how could that stupid cat make it of all things?!
How could he have gotten here? I take in the claw marks from some wild animal, the back paw he holds slightly above the ground, the prominent bones in his face. He's come on foot, then, all the way from 13. Maybe they kicked him out or maybe he just couldn't stand it there without her, so he came looking.
	“Oh my poor Buttercup,” Prim sighed.
"It was the waste of a trip. She's not here," I tell him. Buttercup hisses again. "She's not here. You can hiss all you like. You won't find Prim." At her name, he perks up. Raises his flattened ears. Begins to meow hopefully. "Get out!" He dodges the pillow I throw at him. "Go away! There's nothing left for you here!" I start to shake, furious with him. "She's not coming back! She's never ever coming back here again!" I grab another pillow and get to my feet to improve my aim. Out of nowhere, the tears begin to pour down my cheeks. "She's dead." I clutch my middle to dull the pain. Sink down on my heels, rocking the pillow, crying. "She's dead, you stupid cat. She's dead."</pre>

<pre>After finishing their lunch, the three walked to the entrance to the Headmaster's office. With a call of "Cockroach Clusters!" the gargoyle leapt to the side and the three ascended the moving staircase to the landing outside the Headmaster's door.

Just before Harry knocked, they heard the Headmaster from inside call, "Come in, Harry."

Opening the door, Harry allowed the two girls to precede him inside. Unsurprisingly, Professor Snape was sitting on his stool in the corner.

"Miss Greengrass? Miss Granger?" asked Dumbledore. "I believe I only asked for young Harry to join me."

"You did," answered Daphne, as all three walked up to stand before the desk.

When she didn't say anything else, and Hermione said nothing, he finally asked, "Then, what are you doing here?"

"I asked them to join me, Headmaster," answered Harry. "The same can be asked for why Professor Snape is here."

Snape looked ready to snarl something back, but kept his mouth shut.

"Now, Harry, Professor Snape has my complete trust and confidence," the Headmaster smoothly said.

"In that case," said Harry, just as smoothly. "Miss Greengrass and Miss Granger have my complete trust and confidence."

Before Dumbledore could speak again, Harry went on to say, "You summoned me, Headmaster; and, I am here. What is it you wished to speak to me about? I'd not like to be late to my next class."

"I wished to speak to you alone, Harry," the Headmaster tried.

"Oh," replied Harry. "My apologies." He then looked directly at Snape and asked, "Would you mind escorting my two ladies to wait outside, Professor; while the Headmaster and I converse? I believe we shan't be long."

Snape glared and sneered back before he turned back to the Headmaster. Dumbledore held up his hand and, looking at Harry, said, "I thought I made myself clear, Harry. Professor Snape has my complete trust and confidence."

"And I thought I'd made myself clear, Sir. Miss Greengrass and Miss Granger have my complete trust and confidence. Anything you need to say to me you can say to them. Actually, anything you say to me I'll say to them, anyway. So, their staying here would just, as the muggles would say, cut out the middleman and save time."</pre>

<pre>Laela's once-bright silver eyes were dim, but he heard her voice in his head. 'Galbatorix. Galbatorix, I'm sor- sorry, so… sorry. I can't…'

'Get up,' he whispered. 'Come on, Laela, get up, please, get up, please-,'

'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I have to go.'

He could feel her pain slowly fading away, but in its place came not strength but coldness and lassitude, and he knew what it meant. He tried to heal her, but his magic was not enough. Her injuries were simply too bad to be healed.

Helpless, tears streaming down his face, he put his arms around her head, hugging her as if he would never let her go. 'I don't want you to die!' he sobbed.

Laela looked into his eyes. 'Don't be afraid,' she said gently.

Her eyes closed slowly.

And then, then, then it happened.

The feeling hit him full in the chest, so hard that it flung him backward onto the snow, and with it came pain. But this was not the pain of an injury. As he lay there, gasping, he felt something that only a rider could ever feel. He felt part of himself die.

Galbatorix screamed. The pain was in him, outside him, all around him, destroying him, all of him, everything he had been, everything he was, everything he knew, making him nothing but an animal that thrashed in the snow and screamed. He screamed as he had never screamed before in his life, as no creature should ever be made to scream, a scream that shredded his voice, which broke and ceased to sound even remotely human, and still he screamed. The world around him fell into a million pieces, and darkness took him into it and made him its own.

Then there was no more pain, and he was in the blackness, falling and falling. As he fell he cried out her name. Laela!

But there was no reply. She was dead.</pre>

A manic grin appeared on Sirius's face, and Remus paled as Sirius grabbed him by the arm and dragged him towards the Great Hall.

"Got to go some to beat stealing a dragon," he whispered before snatching Remus's wand. He used it to slam open the Hall's doors and strode forward, dragging Remus behind him. As they entered the Hall Sirius waved the wand and sent a cannon-blast charm into the enchanted ceiling.

As the deafening roar faded, all eyes in the Great Hall turned to the entrance. Sirius immediately pressed his borrowed wand to Remus's temple and yelled "Everybody freeze! I've got a werewolf and I'm not afraid to use him!"

Remus, staring down the Hall directly at the staff table, found it difficult to keep from smiling at the looks on the faces of the teachers, Dumbledore in particular, who looked dumbstruck, an expression Remus couldn't remember ever having seen on his face before. Into the silence a young voice piped up from the Hufflepuff table in a worried tone.

"How are you going to use him, mister?" Remus focused on the end of the table and realised that the speaker was an eleven year old Harry Potter, and he was sitting at the side of Tonks and Cedric Diggory. Had all three of them come back in time, he wondered. Any doubts that Harry was a time traveller were dispelled as he continued.

"Does it involve perverted activities and hot man-on-man love action? Only you look like one of the dirty old men that my uncle warned me about."

Comically, Sirius sprang away from Remus as if he was diseased.

"No it does not," he protested. "Remus and I are just friends. I look like this because of ten years in prison. I only escaped an hour ago. Strangely, there's a distinct lack of male grooming products available in Azkaban." He glanced towards the staff table. "What's your excuse, Snape?"

Snape rose to his feet, wand out and features suffused with rage. "Black. You're an escaped convict and I'll take great delight in putting you down like the dog you are."

"Oh, Severus, you say the nicest things," replied Sirius lightly, before his right hand shot out and grabbed the collar of Ron Weasley, his leap away from Remus having taken him conveniently behind the first year.

Dumbledore finally rose, wand also out. "Put down the boy, Sirius," he commanded. "He's done nothing to harm you."

"I quite agree," replied Sirius equably, his hand rummaging inside Ron's robes before emerging clutching a rat.

"First it's men with moustaches, then small boys," commented Harry from the Hufflepuff table. "Are you sure you're not a dirty old man?"

"I have no interest in small boys," commented Sirius disdainfully. A gleam came into his eye. "Rats, however . . ."

"Oh dear God no," Tonks broke in in apparent horror. "I read about something like that. Two men were, well, gratifying themselves with a hamster and it got stuck. One of them tried to tempt it out with a lit match and accidentally ignited intestinal gases. The hamster shot out like a rocket and broke the chap's nose. What are the two of you going to do with that rat?"

There were looks of equal disgust and puzzlement around the Hall, as older students began to explain Tonks's comment to the younger ones.

"Minerva McGonagall was now on her feet. "Mr Black," she said firmly. "There will be no violating of rats in this school whilst I am Deputy Headmistress. You and Mr Lupin, who I thought better of," she said as she cast a disapproving look at Remus, "should take your quite frankly disturbing activities elsewhere."

"Minerva, it's not like that," protested Remus desperately. "Harry and Tonks are the only people who have suggested that Sirius and I are deviants. I'm a happily married man!"

"Blaming children, now," said McGonagall severely as she walked towards Remus. "Although I hadn't heard that you had married. Who is the, ah, fortunate woman?"

Remus looked at Tonks, who was collapsed against Harry and laughing helplessly, and decided that it wouldn't be wise to claim to be married to one of McGonagall's seventh year students.

"I , er, don't think you know her," he said evasively, before switching his attention back to Sirius. "But more importantly, that rat is a criminal."

+

"Harry?" said a male voice dubiously. "He sounds very young."

"That could be down to the hammerating yackles," responded an ethereal female voice.

"I do not accept that there is any such creature as a hammerating yackle!" yelled another female voice. "I have never heard of it! Is there any empirical evidence for its existence? Have you ever seen a yackle? Do you know anyone who's ever seen a yackle?"

Albus coughed. "I'm not sure it's strictly relevant," he told the portal, "but there are, in fact, three types of yackle. The Oriental, or hammerating, yackle is native to the bamboo forests of southern China. I was fortunate enough to witness one attack and disembowel a giant panda when travelling through Guangdong in the early 1890s."

There was silence from the portal. "Even if that wasn't just a lucky guess," rallied the first voice, "why would there be a yackle at Hogwarts and how would it make Harry sound younger?"

"Whoever you are, you clearly never studied NEWT-level potions," interrupted Snape with a sneer. "Yackle fur is one of the principal ingredients in the vocal-cord tightening potion, which gives the potion's drinker a noticeably altered voice."

There was another silence.

"OK, so you've got lucky this time," accepted the voice, "but what about the blibbering humdingers? The heliopaths? I spent three weeks scouring the restricted section for references to snorkacks and there was nothing! Nothing, I tell you!" it concluded rather manically.

"This is all very interesting," called Harry, before the voice could continue, "but what exactly are you trying to do? And I sound young because I am young. Again."</pre>

<pre>"What is your status, Desaad?" Darkseid demanded immediately.

"Well, my lord," the obsequious underling began, "I have successfully—"

Kara interrupted, "—broken twenty seven mind probes, sixteen hypnosis machines, forty five different power tools… and the record for 'most incompetent bad guy ever'."

The Apokolips' ruler looked at Desaad threateningly. "Explain."

"S-she possesses some sort of telepathic-shielding device, my Lord," Desaad stammered. "I have not quite located it as yet but, rest assured—"

"Then remove her garments and destroy the device. My plans are too important to be delayed by such simple trickery."

The scientist wrung his hands nervously. "M-my Lord, the thing is… I—we!—are unable to… disrobe her. At all."

The room's attention directed itself to Kara, who shrugged as best she could given her restrained state. "What can I say? My boyfriend doesn't like to share."

The hulking dictator turned his crimson eyes on the cringing underling. You try my patience, Desaad."

"I-I will neutralize the device, O Mighty Darkseid. I need only a few more moments of preparation to implement your plan."

"You had best not fail me again, Desaad," Darkseid announced, "for your sake."</pre>

<pre>3 September 1993
Diagon Alley
"Good heavens!" a portly witch screamed, dropping her shopping bags in horror. "It's Sirius Black! And Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter? Where?" Harry looked around frantically. "I don't see him anywhere!"
"Oh," the witch flushed in embarrassment. "For a second I thought... you look just like him!"
"Nonsense," Harry said pompously. "Harry Potter wears glasses. I don't have any glasses on, so obviously I'm not Harry
Potter."
"Exactly," Sirius said from beside him. "See, I may look like Sirius Black from a distance, but Sirius Black doesn't wear
glasses, does he? Since I'm wearing glasses, I'm obviously not Sirius Black."
"Of course, of course," the witch said quickly. "I'm so sorry, gentlemen! I don't know what came over me to make such a
silly mistake."
She bustled away.
"...You mean it's really that easy?" Sirius asked, aghast. "Really?"
"Most wizards haven't an ounce of common sense," Harry paraphrased what Hermione had said at the end of their first
year. "Now come on, the goblins won't be so easy to fool, but they also don't care about silly things like escaped convicts
on the run."</pre>

<pre>In the end the final hand came down to Harry and a Fourth Year Gryffindor girl. The game had started with George Weasley and Professor Vector in as well, but the betting soon became too much for them. Harry did not need to look at his cards when he went all in, an amount of chips approximately equal to twenty Gallons, but he did glance down at the little notebook that held his list of people who owed him markers. The six girls who were organising the signing day each owed him five markers; Tonks also owed him one to get him into the Tournament and there were four other names of players who had bet him markers and lost. He looked down at his pumpkin juice and saw it was empty.

"Can I get another drink?" Harry asked.

"Here you go. Try this." Tonks said.

Harry looked up and his opponent was chewing her lower lip, knowing that even if she went all in she could not match Harry's bet and the thirteen gallons of chips in front of her left enough of a gap that a single marker would probably not cover the difference, but from her expression she seemed to have a good hand.

"What is that?" Harry said after a sip.

"That's Butterbeer. Is that not the best thing you have ever tasted?" Tonks said.

"Bet your ass it is." Harry said, emphatically.

"Ok." The Fourth Year Gryffindor said.

"What?" Harry said.

"All in and I bet my ass." She said, pushing all her chips into the centre of the table.

"Huh?" Harry said.

"Just accept." Tonks ordered.

"Umm… ok." Harry said, still confused much to the amusement of all the onlookers.

"Strait Flush. 8, 9, 10, Jack and Queen of Spades." The Gryffindor girl said.

"Harry?" Tonks asked.

"Royal Flush. Clubs." He replied, laying his cards down face up.

Everyone turned to look at the Gryffindor girl who blushed.

"Hey, at least I loose it to the Harry Potter." She said with a laugh.

Everyone else laughed, even Professor Vector.

"Just give him a few years before you let him collect." The Professor replied, who had bet a few markers herself, but had only had to hand one out.

"Ok, what the hell just happened?" Harry demanded.

Tonks leaned down and whispered in his ear, explaining just what he had won. There was great amusement when Harry's face went bright red and he would have fled the room if Tonks had not held him in place.

"May I present the winner of the first Hogwarts Poker Tournament. Harry Potter." Tonks announced to thunderous applause.</pre>

<pre>Tom stood over Myrtle's dead body, right hand carelessly petting his basilisk, who kept its eyes closed and just... Purred in Parseltongue.

He remained this way for several minutes, drinking in the sight... Celebrating his triumph in silence.

Memories returned to him. Of the Pastor, clad all in black, visiting the orphanage. Tom had to admit, the dressing style appealed to him. Maybe add a mask to it for good measure...

If you don't pray for forgiveness, your immortal soul will be condemned to hell when you die, Tom! These... Things you do aren't good! Miracles are the domain of our Lord!

I do not intend to die, father.

Everyone dies, Tom. It is to be human. Only our souls are immortal.

I do not believe in souls, father.

His Pastor had looked... Shocked when Tom had said this, and in hindsight, the man had had a point.

It pained Tom to admit this, but even though they were painfully ignorant about what to do with them, sometimes even Muggles could've a basic grasp of magical concepts.

And it'd come in rather handily, hadn't it? If only to prove a point.

No... Tom wasn't concerned about his immortal soul. Not anymore.

He'd never leave this world. He'd make it his world. Just like...

And at this point, Tom couldn't help but smirk. Jesus had been a wise man indeed. Not the son of God, perhaps. But his resurrection, mere centuries after Herpo had developed the theories surrounding Horcruxes... Not to mention that he was a direct descendant of the Parselmouth Eve.

Tom was Slytherin enough to connect the dots.

Even though they were divided by two thousand years of history, Tom couldn't help but feel a certain bond with Jesus of Nazareth. A certain fondness towards the man. He wondered whether his Pastor would've appreciated the irony. The atheist Tom Riddle, looking up to Jesus, almost as much as to Salazar Slytherin himself!

Of course, in the end, even Jesus had been a fool. Overcome with grief, with regret – an emotion Tom had long since given up trying to understand –, he'd sacrificed his immortality a mere forty days after his resurrection. Had willingly chosen death and left his disciples to complete his great work.

Tom respected Jesus, but he would never make such an elementary mistake. He, too, was recruiting disciples. He, too, was looking for his twelve apostles... But he'd not leave them behind.</pre>

<pre>"Excuse me, humans. If you would cease your fornication for just a moment, your party is ready to see you," a goblin stated flatly. He then turned and left the room. There was a moment's pause, before the sounds of three people dressing quickly was heard.

Out into the hallway stumbled Harry, Hermione and Tonks, their clothing disheveled and in disarray. Hermione was blushing wildly, as was Harry.

"Oh my God," Hermione mumbled, holding her cheeks. "Oh my God... Oh my God..."

"Yeah," Harry said with a smile. He then looked over at Tonk, and frowned at her look of disappointment.

"Tonks? Something wrong?"

"Mm?" Tonks asked. "No, not really..."

"Did... Did I do anything wrong?" Harry asked gingerly. Tonks stared at him for a moment, then laughed.

"Ha! Hahaha! No no Harry, you were fine... More than fine... I'd give you an 'O' for 'Outstanding', among... Other things..." She grinned and laughed at Harry's resulting blush. "But, the truth is..."

"Yes?" Harry asked.

"Well..." Tonks pouted. "There's no thrill in getting caught if the one catching you doesn't care, you know?"

"You're an exhibitionist!" Hermione gasped. Tonks shook her head.

"No, no... Well yes, a bit, but if there's no consequence for being caught then there's no rush of fear! And fear is heavily linked to erotic response," Tonks said.

"So... It was good?" Harry asked. Tonks laughed again, and hugged him tightly. She kissed the top of his head.

"You're cute, you know that?"

"So I've been told... Repeatedly," Harry mumbled into her boobs with a smile.</pre>

<pre>"Now then... I have asked those members with free time to keep an eye on Harry Potter this last month... Anything to report?" Dumbledore asked, ignoring Snape's sneer at the mention of the Boy-Who-Lived with habitual grace.

Sirius carefully arranged his hands in front of his face, and noticed Tonks' smug look in the background. There was a slight tension in the air that Moody promptly broke.

"The boy's been busy." Moody offered with a smirk as his eye whirled around the room. "He's spent a lot of his time fixing the plumbing all around that muggle neighborhood. I've never seen so many dripping bits in my whole life. And they just keep coming back to him for more, no matter how much servicing he gives em."

Sirius coughed rather loudly.

"My word Sirius, are you all right?" Dumbledore asked.

"Oh, I'm fine... Please, continue," Sirius said, his face quite solemn but his eyes betraying his mirth to everyone but Dumbledore.

"Of course," Dumbledore said with a nod, and looked out to the crowd again.

"It's not just the plumbing. Why, I don't think there's a single cherry on that street that the boy hasn't plucked." Kingsley spoke up, his face completely straight. "And they keep having him come back, to make sure everything is kept properly fertilized."

Tonks couldn't hold back her smug expression. She was glad she'd chosen a seat near the back for that very purpose.

"I wasn't aware there were cherry trees on Privet Drive," Dumbledore hummed thoughtfully. "Live and learn, I suppose…"

"I must admit, he's also very very handy around the homes. I don't think I've ever things lubricated that much." Hestia spoke up, managing to keep her face completely straight. "They seem to glisten all on their own, whenever he shows up!"

"Any accidental magic reports?" Dumbledore asked, concerned. "He hasn't been using any, has he?"

"It's all completely natural from what I've seen." Moody almost leered as he glanced over at Tonks, smirking broadly. "No magical enhancement in the least."

It was only thanks to her Metamorphmagus skills Tonks was able to avoid blushing. She smirked back. "He's quite good with his hands..."

Snape snorted. "It figures that menial labor is his forte..."

With practiced ease, the majority of the Order resisted rolling their eyes at Snape's statement.

"He's been having to do a lot of laundry too." Kingsley added. "Lots and lots of dirty sheets."

"The Dursleys aren't working him too hard, are they?" Molly Weasley asked, concerned.

"No, I'd say they're the only ones he's not really doing any work for... Thank Merlin for that." Hestia spoke up as she couldn't help but shudder at the thought.

"He does enjoy being out of the house, Albus," Minerva pointed out, her lips twitching slightly. "The neighborhood is treating him better than those people ever did..."

"Arabella, what do you have to report?" Dumbledore asked, turning to the spinster Squib in the corner.

"... I have honestly never heard of a boy with such stamina, Albus." The woman responded as she lightly tapped the side of her cheek. "He's doing all that work, and yet, he just keeps coming back for more with a smile on his face. I can't never heard of anyone going like he does. And it's only seemed to do him a world of good."

"Remus?" Dumbledore asked, knowing of the concern Lupin had been giving to the son of his best friend.

"I think it's the gardening." Remus mused aloud as he would lightly stroke his chin. "He seems to truly love planting his seed...s in every home on the block. And he's certainly gotten everyone's attention with his skill in doing it."

Tonks couldn't help her laughter at this.

"Mm? Nymphadora, what's so funny?" Dumbledore asked.

Sirius was barely able to keep his own face straight at this point, though he certainly wasn't alone on that front.

"Ah... Just a funny joke I remembered, nothing important," she said with a grin.

"Really? I could use a good laugh, would you kindly share it?" Dumbledore asked with a smile.

Tonks bowed her head, shoulders shaking.

"Um, it's ah..." Tonks paused a moment, before grinning sheepishly. "Sirius tells it better than I do."

"Sirius?" Dumbledore asked.

Sirius paused a moment, before turning and smirking softly at Tonks. "Oh, dear cousin, I'm so glad you trust me with that! Why, it's so good to know I have the trust of one of my favorite members of my family... Whatever would I do without someone like you to help me, *ahem* take care of my godson?"

"Merlin pray we never find out," murmured Minerva.

"Sorry Dumbledore, it might not be appropriate for an audience," Sirius said with a smile. "Besides, the reports must go on, correct?"

"Ah, good... Anything else to report?" Dumbledore asked. A kind of game had sprung up, and every member of the Order wanted to one-up the others. After all, aside from Snape's dramatic, self-important monologues and seeing who made the best snacks, these meetings were boring and unproductive.

"Well, there was the bit where Harry was taking care of those twins..." Kingsley mused aloud. "They really seemed to rather enjoy the way he handled the curves... of their furniture... Their mother was so impressed, she had him stay further and take a look at some of her own before helping her make sure her plumbing was still up to par."

"He did seem to have a run in with the Muggle Aurors," Emmeline contributed. "Even went off with one in her car."

"Was it anything serious?" Dumbledore asked.

"Well, he was handcuffed," Emmeline said. "And he was questioned and tested... Thoroughly, all through the night. In the end, she was far more satisfied than I've ever been at the end of an investigation." She almost blushed with that admission, but kept her face firmly controlled. "She even allowed him to handcuff her later on."

"Muggle police are worthless," Snape muttered.

"Oh? Sounds a bit strange," Dumbledore said. "Are you sure there's been no infiltration? No use of Imperio on anyone in the neighborhood?"

"Most assuredly not. The investigations were far too muggle for it to have been a Death Eater behind it."

"Still, very strange," Dumbledore mused.

"The investigation seems to be ongoing," Hestia contributed. "She can't get enough... Information, I mean."

"Hm, this sounds unfortunate," Dumbledore said. "Perhaps this policewoman needs to be Obliviated."

"I think that would be a very, very bad idea." Hestia cut in quickly as she shook her head. "Harry has gotten into a routine of greeting her... and if she suddenly stopped remembering him and the investigation, then well... Things would get... complicated for him."

"What is this investigation about, anyway? Harry's not a criminal!" Molly demanded.

"As Emmeline said... he's HELPING with the investigation, Molly, he's not the subject of it. He's a very, very valuable source that's helping her drill... for information," Hestia quickly covered. Minerva's lips twitched significantly at this point.

"Well, as long as he's not in danger of prosecution, I see no need to interfere," Dumbledore said. He looked around the room. "Anything else?"

"Tonks, be sure he gets plenty of fluids, won't you?" Moody spoke up smirking at the girl. "With all that work, I'm sure he needs it."

"Mm? Nymphadora, did you actually make contact with Harry?" Dumbledore asked, his eyebrows rising.

"Oh, no she hasn't, but she's the closest of us to his age, and we DO want to make sure he's staying healthy, right, Albus?" Moody spoke up, his non-magical eye winking at Tonks where Dumbledore, Snape and Molly couldn't see.

"Ah yes, of course..." Dumbledore frowned. "There is one issue though... Miss Granger apparently disregarded my request, and visited Harry at his home." He looked about the room.

"While she poses no danger to Harry, I would appreciate knowing more about her visit. Tonks, you were on duty when she arrived, what can you tell me?"

"My fault." Sirius raised his hand and shrugged slightly. "She apparently took some of the things I was talking to Remus about out of context. She thought he was in danger from his relatives and them overworking him. So, naturally being a good, intimate friend, she immediately went to make sure he was safe..."

Sirius paused a moment, before eying Dumbledore neutrally. "You don't have a problem with a young lady making certain one of her best friends is all right, do you?"

"Of course not," Dumbledore said. "But given that she is known as a friend of Harry's, I'm simply concerned about her being used, unwittingly mind you, as a means to cause him harm. How did she locate his home?"

"She looked him up in the phonebook." Tonks said simply.

Silence. Dumbledore nodded.

"Ah... I see... How did her visit go?" He asked.

"Aren't you at all concerned that she found him in so simple a way, Albus?" Minerva asked flatly.

"Not at all... She meant him no harm, therefore, she could enter. However, those who meant to do him harm following her might lead to danger for the rest of the neighborhood," Albus explained. "And Harry would no doubt be drawn into it."

Even Severus looked skeptical of this, but Sirius decided to get things back on track. He'd worry about getting Harry somewhere safe later.

"So Tonks, how'd the visit go?" Sirius asked.

"Well, she expressed her concern about how much effort he's been putting in out of the house," Tonks said, barely repressing a snort. "So he proceeded to… Assure her that he was in no danger… Even proceeded to demonstrate some of the things he's learned, things he's doing… All to convince her that he is in… " Her eyes glazed a bit, "perfect form. I feel he was… Very convincing," her voice ended in a drawl. Many of the other witches in the room developed glazed looks of their own.

"Indeed," Dumbledore observed. "Well, if there is no further business...?"

"Oui, one more beet, Dumbledore," Fleur Delacour spoke up. "I was wondering if I could not participate in guarding 'Arry? I owe 'im my sister's life-It is the least I can do for 'im."

Tonks immediately glanced over at Fleur, eying her speculatively before looking back at Dumbldeore. "I'll be happy to show her the ropes a few times."

"Certainly Fleur," Dumbledore said with a smile, pleased that so many volunteers were willing to protect Harry. "You may start on Monday."

"Wonderful," Fleur purred.

"Well, as it is late... Sirius? What are you doing?" Dumbledore asked.

"Just... Stretching my arms," Sirius said with a wry smile, as he managed to keep himself from doing a victory dance. "I'm just... overcome with all the concern for my godson's well-being."

"I'm afraid you cannot leave to guard him, Sirius, it would be far too dangerous," Dumbledore said with true regret.

"I'm sure he'll be happy to be in their more than capable hands." Sirius quickly nodded his head. "And I'm sure they'll take extra special care of him."

"Don't worry Cousin... We'll make sure he doesn't regret a single moment of his summer," Tonks said with a grin.

Dumbledore felt his old heart swell with pride. He'd had fears about the reborn Order's ability to function, but now he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that, even if Harry wasn't here, he was bringing them together in the fight against the Darkness. He was filled with hope.

As well as some bemusement when later, after the meeting had broken up, Sirius and the Weasley twins began chanting Harry's name in celebration in the drawing room.</pre>

<pre>As the story unfolded, it was a relieved father who discovered just what Harry staying with the girls involved. That relief vanished as someone knocked on the front door. Wondering if it could be the local police, checking on who was staying at a cottage that had been empty for a few years, Dan answered the door with two witches standing behind him.

Hermione's cry of 'Sirius' alerted the parents who these two gentlemen were, her rushing into the arms of this man confirmed they were friends. Sirius held Hermione tight but couldn't hold back the tears.

"Moony, they don't know - and I can't tell them."

It was left to Remus to break the bad news as Hermione dragged them into the kitchen.

"There's no easy way to say this, Harry's been kissed."

"I know, we were there." Sirius and Remus were looking at Dan as if he was crazy but Hermione's smile just got wider.

"My dad is right, and I was the one doing the kissing..."

At that, Harry entered the kitchen towelling his hair. Sirius sank to his knees in disbelief while Remus wasn't in much better condition, only leaning on the wall keeping him upright. Harry ran over and Sirius' head was chest hight on him as they needfully clung to each other, his godfather sobbing in relief.

Remus was watching that touching scene while looking to Hermione for some answers.

"The simple version is Harry's soul wasn't in his body when the dementor kissed it. Of course when Harry Potter is involved, nothing is ever bloody simple."

Instead of a reprimand about his daughter's use of bad language, this comment received a growled acknowledgement from Dan. "We're beginning to find that out for ourselves."</pre>

<pre>It had been a nervous day for the Wizarding world. The Wizard Wireless Network had reported a major disaster at the Ministry building, including the death of the current Minister of Magic. Then word came from Wiltshire of some strange disaster that resulted in the destruction of one of the Wizarding Worlds most sacred relics, Stonehenge. Finally, word came of a massive Death Eater attack on Hogsmeade and Hogwarts.

People in the hospital were afraid. It was generally agreed that it was only a matter of time before the Death Eaters attacked St. Mungos.

The receptionist looked up as the door burst open and a large group of men led by three red heads hustled into the lobby. She started to reach for the panic button, and then froze as she found herself staring down the business end of twenty-three wands.

“Welcome to St. Mungos,” she squeaked instead.

“Why thank you, my dear,” said one red headed man with a dashing smile. Behind him the other two red heads, obviously twins, smirked.

“Can I direct you?” asked the receptionist, trying to rebuild what little Hufflepuff courage she had.

The oldest of the three red heads smiled sadly.

“Actually no,” said one of the twins.

“This is a stickup,” said the other with an infectious grin. The tough men behind the two twins all grinned.

“But this is a hospital!” protested the receptionist.

“And you’re part of the loot, my pretty!” cackled one of the twins.

“Oy! I saw her first!” said the other.

The other red head smacked them both in the head. “No more muggle television for you two!” he swore, and then he held out a hand with an empty sack. “Would you deposit your wand in here please? I promise you will get it back soon.”

The young witch placed her wand in the sack and trembled in fear. One of the twins wagged his eyebrows at her.

“Bring her along,” said Bill Weasley, “and lock down the doors.”

Bill looked at the twins and shook his head in dismay. “I know I’m going to regret this, but you two take team one and get the main waiting room as well as the emergency rooms.”

Fred and George grinned evilly at Bill and nodded eagerly. Then Bill turned to the rest of the group with him. “You lot know your jobs. Healers and medi-witches first, then patients and finally books, potions and any other goodies you find. Strip the building. Dobby has already spoken to the elves.”

Nodding, the men moved off to their appointed tasks.

Fred had a hand loosely on the arm of the receptionist. He turned and looked her over with a grin. She wasn’t sure what he had in mind, but she was coming to understand they really wouldn’t hurt her. His next words shocked her totally.

“I say, you wouldn’t have to have a sister, would you?” he asked hopefully.

She shook her head and he looked disappointed, then he leaned in close. “It’s for my lazy brother. He pouts if I get all the pretty birds and he doesn’t,” he said in a voice loud enough for George to hear.

“Hey now! I do not pout!” protested George. Then he went off in the direction of the main waiting room. He kicked open the door and fired off a concussion hex, causing those within to shriek and duck.

“Don’t anyone move! We’re hijacking this hospital in the name of the British Organized Wizarding Elite Liberation Movement!” he shouted.

“That’s really a shitty name. I mean, BOWEL-Movement?” commented Fred.</pre>

<pre>Hogwarts lost its Potions Master, even over the strenuous objections of the Hogwarts Headmaster. "But I trust him, you see. I trust him."

"Very good, sir. Then you can apply for a permit to come and visit him, too. We've gotten Pensieve testimony that Snape has cast all three of the Unforgivable Curses banned under EMU[European Magical Union] treaties. He's responsible for the deaths of more than a few witches and wizards, sir."

"But Severus Snape is no more a Death Eater than I am."

"I guess we'll have to go over your life more carefully then, sir. We had thought you were fairly clean. I'll flag you for extra scrutiny."</pre>

<pre>Fleur finally seemed to realize exactly who Harry was, she shot him a terrible glare. Krum stalked out, Karkaroff walking next to him. Karkaroff was still fuming, judging from the furious Bulgarian he was spouting. Maxime came to Fleur, and laid a hand on her shoulder. Simultaneously speaking in French to Fleur,

"Come Fleur, we should leave this inferior boy. You need your rest to show everybody exactly how talented you are." She spoke. Unfortunately for Maxime though, Harry was a rather well-read person. Amongst the books he read, there were plenty of books in other languages. This had lead to Harry learning French, Latin, Chinese and Gobbledygook. Although he was still studying Gobbledygook... Ah well, not relevant right now.

"Inferior Madame? I believe others would consider that rude. Fortunately, I am aware of you being French, and thus having an enormous superiority complex. So, I forgive you. Also, Miss Delacour, I am aware of myself being rather dashing. But your infatuated looks are not going to have any effect, as you do not satisfy the requirements a woman must satisfy in order for me to be interested in her. Now then, Good night to you both." Harry spoke up, in fluent, perfect French. He even had the accent right.

Harry left the women with their mouths open. Bagman and Crouch, who were still standing in the room as well, looked quite stunned as well. Harry simply turned and left the room. If Dumbledore wanted him to go to his office, he'd do so. And hey, if Dumbledore took long enough, Harry might even be able to play a game of chess against William and Fawkes. William was the name the Sorting Hat had been given by Harry. William and Fawkes made a mean team when cooperating. The only way to beat them was by getting them to argue.

Ah well... Even so, it was always great fun in Albus' office!

++

The girl looked completely baffled. The only thing she managed to get out, was a stunned and shaky,

"What?"

"You, fire elemental, lose control, burn down Hall, me, ice elemental, stop you, me hero, you weak. Me bring you to Potion woman. You good now." Harry grunted out like a caveman.

"You understand now?"

"What! I'm not stupid! You are! Bastard!" The girl yelled out, fury in every part of her expression and voice.

Harry knew what he was doing though. He was provoking the girl into flaming, without doing any more. So she would keep control whilst being covered in flames. Harry was hoping they'd be able to skip the denial phase.

"Girl stupid. Me man. Man smart! Girl listen to man! Man power! You silent now! You make me sandwich! We men, we talk difficult. You stupid! You no understand!" Harry continued on. Dumbledore made an affirmative grunt, already having caught on to the game Harry was playing.

And it worked like a charm!

" Why you! You... GIT!" She yelled. Simultaneously, her entire body was covered in small, orange flames.

Harry immediately acted, before the girl got more angry and lost control again.

"I'm sorry Rachel, I greatly respect you and I think you are very intelligent. Also, please take note of the flames which are covering your body." Harry calmly spoke. He sounded earnest, although it took him a lot of effort to say those things about a foolish, temperamental Gryffindor.

"Wait what?"Rachel spoke. Before looking at her hands. Before she could panic, Dumbledore interfered, eager on skipping the panic phase as well.

"And also take note that you are not hurt and that the flames are already dying out."

"Huh... Oh yeah. You're right. So I'm really a fire elemental? What will I be able to do? How can I use it?" A suddenly eager sounding Rachel said.

"Your tutor will explain all of that. Speaking of which, Harry, when are you available?" Dumbledore calmly replied to Rachel, after which he turned his questioning eyes to Harry.

"Monday, from 8.30 to 11.30 a.m., Thursday, from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., we will eat during training. As it is Sunday by now, that means I expect to see Miss Owens at 8.30 sharp, in the Entrance Hall. One minute late, and you will find her another tutor. My time, unlike hers, is valuable. Now then, I plan on taking profit from euphoria and the effects of Firewhiskey on attractive, female Ravenclaw students, I'm kinda horny right now." Harry spoke, before leaving. Letting Dumbledore explain to Rachel that her tutor, would indeed be Harry.</pre>

<pre>Charlie Watson walked into his supervisor’s office. “Boss, I have a really weird request.”

“Must be part of the Harry Potter case then,” came the chuckled reply.

Charlie snorted. “You don’t know the half of it. How much of the case have you heard?”

“Not much. One victim was A-K’d and disappeared into thin air, and the other was bashed in the back of the head with a candlestick and A-K’d to make sure he couldn’t get up and try again. The caved in skull guy was the one who’d A-K’d the first one.”

“Pretty good, but not all of it. I need permission to go to London and interview someone.”

“A witness?”

“The first victim.”

“Potter. The first victim had to be Potter.” Charlie nodded. “Casting Avada Kedavra on most people kills them. It just pisses him off. How in hell did he get to London?”

“I don’t know, that’s the thing. We’re pretty damned sure that it’s him, but I want to eyeball him to be sure, and talk to him face to face. I mean, the kid lived with me for a while – I think I’ve got a feel for how to tell if this guy over there is the real deal. His girlfriends think it is.”</pre>

<pre>147. Scene by tverret.  Reproduced here with modifications.

Harry Potter sat alone in the Gryffindor common room working on his potions essay late one spring night when a despondent Dobby appeared behind him with a crack.  Harry jumped, startled by the House Elf.  "Dobby!" he exclaimed, clutching at his chest.

The small creature twisted his ears and cried, "D-Dobby is sorry, Harry Potter Sir!"

Calming down, Harry said, "Don’t worry about it, Dobby; no harm done."  Harry patted the smaller creature's shoulder.

At these words, Dobby started crying even more.  "B-But, D-Dobby is causing great harm, H-Harry Potter."  He started banging his head into the table Harry had been using.

Harry grabbed Dobby again, stopping the elf from causing greater harm to himself.  "Dobby, I doubt that you could cause any harm."

"B-But Dobby did, Harry Potter Sir."  Dobby reached up and grabbed Harry’s shirt, pulling the young wizard closer to his face. "Dobby is just hiding the body before coming here," the elf whispered.

"The WHAT? Dobby, what do you mean 'the body'?" Harry yelped.

Dobby began to explain what had happened.

"Dobby was cleaning the nasty dirty laundry of Harry Potter Sir's roommates - great wizards that they are to be sharing room with the greatest, Harry Potter sir. Dobby was banishing sheets from Harry Potter Sir’s bed - Dobby so loves changing Harry Potter Sir’s sheets - when Dobby was scared like Dobby has never been scared before! Dobby heard a noise under Harry Potter Sir’s Bed. It was a wizard, and he was speaking to something in his hand, a mirror or a hair brush, Dobby isn’t sure. The man was saying into his hairbrush, ‘Wormtail,’ he is saying, ’youse is better being right about this plan.  The secret passages is getting me this far.’ Well, after Dobby is hearing this, Dobby be letting out a little squeak of terror - as us house elves do sometimes - and he turned from under the bed and…  It was awful, Harry Potter Sir! Well, he was there, hiding under Harry Potter Sir’s bed.  Dobby was seeing his eyes, just like Dobby has been hearing about in the Kitchens! Dobby was so scared that Dobby banished him instead of the sheets that Dobby was supposed to be changing.  Dobby is so sorry, Harry Potter Sir!"  Dobby stared hitting himself again.

"Dobby, what are you talking about?  Who was under my bed?  It wasn’t…"

"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Harry Potter Sir!"

Harry jumped up so fast that the couch that he was sitting on almost fell over.  "Voldemort?  Here?" he nearly shouted

Dobby fell over with fright when Harry jumped up. "Harry Potter Sir is a great and powerful wizard, to say his name!"  Dobby looked up from his position on the floor in clear adoration before his face fell into distress again.  "No, sir, he isn’t here any more.  I banished him to the laundry, sir!"

Harry wasn't listening.  "We have to tell somebody, Dobby!  He’s here!"

"No, sir; he isn’t, sir. Dobby banished him to the laundry."

Harry had finally heard what Dobby was saying and looked at the excitable house elf.  "We have to stop him, Dobby.  Where is the laundry?"

"Does Harry Potter Sir remember that Dobby is being knowing how gillyweed makes wizards to be able to breath underwater?"

Harry nodded impatiently.

"Dobby is being knowing that because the merfolk do the washing part of the laundry in the deepest part of the lake."

". . . And you banished Voldemort to the deepest part of the lake?"

"Harry Potter Sir must not say his name!"

"That doesn’t matter right now, Dobby!  What happened to him?"

"Well, Dobby is realizing that Dobby was doing something bad, sending a human to the bottom of the lake without his wand -"

"Wait, you disarmed Voldemort?"

"Oh no, Harry Potter Sir.  Dobby is just forgetting to banish wand with the wizard.  Bad-nasty wizard goes, wand stays"

"So Voldemort was at the bottom of the lake with no wand."  Harry sat down again.  "So, I assume that he drowned at the bottom of the lake then?"

"Oh no, Harry Potter Sir. Dobby is not being allowed to let anyone drown, even mean-nasty wizard like him. Dobby is rescuing him.  He was very angry at Dobby, even though Dobby was promising to punish himself.  Then he was even more angry when Dobby was forgetting his wand in Harry Potter Sir’s room. He demanded that Dobby dry him off."

"So what did you do, Dobby?"

"Well, Dobby was so frightened, Dobby did what any house-elf would do after something goes in washer.  Dobby is sending him to the dryer."

"Dobby, what - or where - is the dryer?" Harry asked slowly.

"Dryer is dragon named Lucille in the basement.  She makes clothes very dry very quickly.  Mean-nasty wizard get burnt.  Dobby just tried to get him dry.   Lucille just got scared, like Dobby did.  She burned the bad man."

Harry looked at the house-elf hopefully.  "So Voldemort died from dragon burns?"

"Oh no, Harry Potter Sir.  Dobby is healing He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and Dobby still is apologizing to bad, bad man. Dobby is so scared. He said that Dobby was to put him back where I got him under the bed. Bad man was most insistent about being put back, so Dobby thinks to Dobby’s self, 'Bad man is washed and dried, so Dobby will put him away, like he is asking.'"

"So how did he die, Dobby?"

"Dobby is not thinking, remember that Dobby is very, very scared. So Dobby is doing what Dobby always does when putting things away."

"What is that, Dobby?"

"Dobby is… is folding him, sir. Dobby is breaking his neck when Dobby is doing that.. Dobby is sorry, sir."

When Harry had started casting a spell, Voldemort had initially begun casting a shield.  He stopped, though, when he recognized the spell that Harry was casting.  Instead, the dark lord simply watched in mounting incredulity as Harry Potter continued the long incantation.

When the young man finished the spell, Voldemort threw his head back and laughed.  "Do you know what that spell was you just cast, Potter?"

"It's a Suicide Spell," Harry answered calmly.

"Recognize the futility of fighting me, do you?  Wanting to get out before watching all your friends die?"

"Not at all.  That particular spell calls the Grim Reaper to collect your soul."

Voldemort nodded, having recognized the spell from his research.  "You have less than a minute.  Any last words?"

Harry grinned at him.  He tapped his scar.  "We share a soul, Tommy."  He reached into his pack and extracted his Invisibility Cloak, one of the three Hallows.  "And unlike you, I can hide from even him."

After Harry and the Diggory boy's body were Portkeyed away, Voldemort turned his fuming gaze to his followers.

And blinked in surprise.  Earlier he hadn't noticed, but they were all thin and definitely ill.  "What is wrong with you all?  You're all ill?"

The robed Death Eaters exchanged looks before Malfoy stepped forward.  "Yes, My Lord, we are."

"Speak.  What is wrong?"

"My Lord, in our prime you recall all the rapes, murders, mayhem, pillaging, and rapes we performed?"

"You said rape twice."

"I like rape."

"Very well.  Yes, I recall our glorious past that will again become reality."

"What we didn't know about at the time is that some of our victims were carries of various venereal diseases.  Unfortunately, My Lord, even modern wizarding medicine does not have a cure for many of them, and well, you see . . ."  Malfoy went on to describe in broad strokes what was happening to them all.  "And in conclusion, Master, I hope my recollections of your participation are incorrect because there is no cure for these diseases."</pre>

<pre>“Good morning, class.”

“Good morning, professor Umbridge.”

“Now, this is NEWT-level Defence against the Dark arts, and according to this silly, silly curriculum, you children are supposed to use spells against each other. Obviously, we will therefore divide you by blood. Yes, Miss Granger?”

“Why does that matter, Professor?”

The pink blob looked at the young witch with disdain.
Harry smiled and raised his hand.

“I would think that would be obvious. Perhaps Mr Potter can answer your silly little question.”

Harry jumped out of his seat and stood at attention next to it.

“Certainly Professor. No pureblood can be expected to last against someone with more potent blood.”

Umbridges face cycled through several unpleasant hues before settling for a pasty white with pink spots. She obviously couldn't believe someone to be so misinformed.

“What do you mean by that?”

“Simple, Professor. Blood isn't purified through the generations. It's recycled. After a few generations, the magic in it dwindles unless there's an infusion of more potent heritage from somewhere. Two muggleborn parents never ever has a Squib child. That's a staleblood thing. Neville here is about as pure as they get. Come on, mate. Reducto my nose.”

Neville didn't hesitate for even a second. He pulled out his wand and cast the curse straight at his friend's face. The colour, speed and luminosity clearly told everybody that he wasn't holding back. It was a killer curse if it connected. However, it hit something about an inch from Harry's face, and dissipated over the surface of the invisible shield. Dolores Umbridge wasn't stupid enough to fall for such an obvious set-up, however. It was time to make this little half-blood crawl back into whatever hole he'd been hiding in.

“Interesting. Now, Mr Malfoy. Please cast a blasting curse at Mr Potter's nose.”

A vicious grin appeared on the blonde boy's face, as he drew his wand, and with an elaborate jerk launched a Bombarda at his foe. Harry grinned. He kept grinning when the slower spell impacted on his shield and was absorbed without a trace. Before the failed result had even registered with the little ponce, he found himself shackled to the desk by heavy iron chains, and his wand was in Harry's hand.

“Professor, did you just order a student to attack another with a blasting curse?”

“Of course I did. Just like you.”

“But I asked him to fire at me, not you. To use that example would require Miss Malfoy to fire at you, not me. These events have been recorded and will certainly be revisited. Please continue.”</pre>

<pre>About an hour into their trip, they received their first knock - after they first heard a yelp.

Laughing among themselves, Harry was about to get up and go take a look when Blaise said, "You wait there; oh, great and wonderful Lord Slytherin. Allow this lowly peasant to see what they want."

Harry, of course, the great and powerful Lord he is, blew him a raspberry.

Grinning back, Blaise walked to the door and opened it. Someone tried to step in and he blocked them from doing so.

"Blaise?" called Harry, wondering what was going on.

"It's a prefect, my Lord," he replied, calling back. "They seem insistent they be allowed in."

Harry sighed and muttered to Daphne, "I think I better go and resolve this issue to ensure it doesn't happen again."

She nodded and pulled back. "Go forth, my hero; and deal with the scoundrel."

Harry just snorted as the others laughed or giggled.

Walking over to the door, he said to Blaise, "Alright; I've got this. Thanks, Blaise."

As Blaise stepped out of his way, Harry stepped forward to block the door. He was faced with yet another angry Slytherin. This one, a girl and prefect. There was a second one standing behind her, also with an angry expression. "Alright," he sighed. "Why don't you try and tell me what this is about. Hmm?"

She thrust her chest out at him, turning just slightly, and angrily asked, "Do you know what this is?"

Harry looked down for a couple of moments before looking back up again to meet her eyes. "A nice pair of boobs?" he asked, trying to act innocent.

It was ruined by Blaise, standing just apart from him, snorting and choking while trying not to laugh.

"Not my boobs!" she barked at him, making the girls behind Harry squeal with laughter.

"What? You mean they're fake?" he gasped. "Can I squeeze 'em and see for myself?"

"No!" the girl practically screamed at him, going red with anger. His friends were practically howling with laughter behind him, while the girl behind her went red with embarrassment and had to look away.

Ignoring the laughter, she raised her hand and pointed at a prefect badge on the lapel of her robes, and said, "I meant - this!"

"I believe it's called a finger," Harry blandly replied.

Blaise hurried away half-choking on suppressed laughter.

"This - is a prefect badge!" she snarked.

"Oh, tha-at!" said Harry. "It's very pretty. Now, what does that have to do with you wanting to come into my private carriage?"

"It is the job of a prefect to inspect the Express. We have rounds and duties to follow," she said quite snootily, calming down again.

"Really?" asked Harry. "Tell me, what does the engineer look like?"

"Pardon?" she spluttered. Again, thrown off her stride.

"I asked you what the engineer looks like," Harry repeated. "If it's your job to inspect the Express; then, surely, you've been up to the engine compartment. Right?"

Spluttering again, she said, "No. Errr - No. I mean - it's our job to inspect the compartments to ensure the students are all safe."

"Good for you!" said Harry, suddenly beaming. "Then, go do so. There are no compartments in this private owners' carriage. Good day!" And slammed the door shut in her face.

He spun around and winked at his friends, and waited.

Sure enough, there was a bare hesitation before there was a banging on the door.

Evilly smirking at his friends, he changed his expression to one of polite enquiry, and spun back to the door.

Opening it and stepping back in to block the doorway he asked, "Yes?"

The same girl and her friend were still there. "As a prefect, I demand you let me in!"

"I'm not a prefect," said Harry, looking confused. "I'm the owner. Weren't you at the Leaving Feast, where I explained all this?"

"No, I'm a prefect," she said in angered exasperation. "And, I demand you let me in!"

Having now had enough fun with the idiot, Harry said, "I'm the owner; and I demand you go away! And, as the owner, I'm overriding your Head of House's instructions and altering your duties. As of right now, like the engine, the owners' carriage is not part of the train the prefects need to inspect. Good day to you, Miss I. Emma Prefect."

Furious again, she hissed, "We'll see about this!" And she spun about and stormed away; her friend trailing after her.

Just as Harry was about to close the door, the Weasley twins hurried around the corner. Both laughing.

"Hi, gents!" said Harry. "Come on in!" And stepped back, holding the door open for them.

The twins came in laughing.

"We think little Miss Henrietta Vaisey..."

"... is most wroth with you, Harry."

"Is that who that was?" asked Harry. "I thought she was I. Emma Prefect; though, she never actually introduced herself. I was just going to ask her what the 'I' stood for. But, I thought it might have been one of those horrid names like 'Ianthya', and she'd decided to use her middle name, instead. I was even going to introduce myself as H. James Potter and see if we could have found some common ground.

"Because - I tell ya - I wouldn't mind getting my hands on those fake boobs of hers and finding out whether they were spongy, or firm, or have much play in them, or even if it was just bra stuffing..."

"Harry James Potter!" Daphne barked at him with a squeal, interrupting his train of thought.

Looking around, Harry could see Blaise and the twins where rolling around on the floor literally howling with laughter, Neville was getting repeatedly smacked by a bright red Hannah while laughing his heart out, and the other girls, including Daphne and - especially - Luna, were bright red with embarrassment.

"Wha-at?" he asked, really playing up the innocent game. "You think they might not be fake, after all? That, she lied to me?" With a huff he said, "Well, that's just rude!"

"You will not talk about another girl's boobs, fake or otherwise..." Daphne barked at him before she was interrupted by another hard knocking on the door. "Oh, for Merlin's sake!" she huffed.

"I'll get it!" Harry sing-songed, as he practically skipped back to the door.

Opening it the same as with Miss Fake Boobs (or not) Vaisey, Harry asked, "Yes?"

The young woman on the other side drew herself up and said, "Mister Potter..."

"Lord Potter," interrupted Harry. Looking over her shoulder, Harry could see the delectable Miss Vaisey standing back and arrogantly smirking in perceived triumph.

"Mister Potter..." she tried again

"Lord Potter," he interrupted again.

With a sigh she said, "Very well. Lord Potter, I'm Head Girl Melin..."

"No-no!" Harry interrupted, appearing a little panicky. "You can't just be turning up at the door of my private carriage and offering me head, like that. My fiancée is sitting just over there..." he gestured, "... and she'd kill me if she..."

"Lord Potter," the girl interrupted, spluttering. "I assure you, I'm not here offering to give you head..."

"Oh! You want me to give it, do you?" interrupted Harry, pretending to catch on. "Sorry, but this tongue is reserved for that lovely..." he tried to gesture behind him as he was interrupted back.

"Lord Potter," the girl angrily interrupted, again, as Daphne and whoever else squealed behind him. This girl was really starting to channel that red blush now. "I'm not giving, or receiving, head from..."

"Well, I bet that really pisses your boyfriend off!" said Harry. "Oh! No! Sorry! Wait!" he mock-spluttered with horror, as the girl looked back with a similar expression. "You're aware of the laws surrounding Heads of Noble Houses being able to have more than one wife, and you're here to hint what you'd like to do to me if given a chance! I get it! That's what that 'head' remark was all about. Alright Miss Head - wink, wink - Girlmelin. I can play that game. I'd like to talk about my broomstick, and wonder if you'd like to take a ride on it - wink, wink."

She slapped him and stormed off.

Harry closed the door and turned back to his friends. "Well, I think that went very well; don't you?"

While everyone else - including the girls, this time - where laughing - some from embarrassment - blushing and trying not to laugh, Hermione walked over and grabbed him by the chin with her left hand. "Here, you," she growled, raising her wand and casting a Healing Charm on the handprint that had sprung up on his cheek.

When she finished, she stepped back, glared at him and said, "You're incorrigible, you know that?" And, not waiting for an answer, she spun about and marched back to her chair.

People had just started settling down again when there was yet another yelp - male, this time - followed by a banging on the door.

Harry immediately grinned and started to rise when Daphne snagged him by the back of his robes and yanked him back into his seat. "Oh, no, you don't!" she half-growled. As Harry tried to straighten himself out she turned to Blaise and asked, "Blaise? Would you mind?"

With a grin, Blaise said, "Not at all, Milady" And jumped to his feet before hurrying to the door.

He hesitated, just a moment, before yanking the door open and stepping into the gap. Before the boy on the other side could say anything, Blaise called back with a bit of a whine in his voice, "Oh, Merlin! Harry, you were supposed to tell the service we wanted girl prostitutes! They sent us a bloke!"

"I am not a prostitute!" squawked the male voice from beyond the door.

"No, no!" said Blaise, with his off hand coming up in a placating gesture. "I didn't mean to give offence! What's that term they use, these days? Oh, yes! You're a lady's close male companion. That's right; isn't it?"

Harry began giggling. He hated when he did that. But, it's what he did when he was trying to stifle his laughter. It didn't help that Daphne kept smacking him up the back of the head, as he was doing so.

"I am not that, either!" squawked the boy, even more indignant.

"Of course not," Blaise scoffed. "You need to be discreet. I understand that.

"Now, no one here ordered your - specialised services, if you know what I mean - so, we're sorry you undertook a wasted trip. However, we can make it worth your while. And, my, you do have the body for it, don't you?

"There's a girl running about on the train who goes by the name 'Head Girlmelin', she appears to be quite - umm - in need of a close male companion, if you know what I mean. Could you go and - you know - have a chat with her and this other girl named 'I Emma Prefect' - who, we think, has fake boobs, quite frankly.

"Both of them and some others wearing nice shiny badges - like you've got there - seem to be operating under the misconception they have a right to enter the private carriage of Lord Potter-Slytherin-Gryffindor. They don't, of course; but, they do seem insistent. I think it might be repressed sexual urges clouding their logical thought centres."

Harry had abandoned his seat next to Daphne on the couch to escape getting hit all the time, and joined the other guys - including Neville - on the floor of the carriage, rolling around trying not to laugh.

"Please go and - you know," said Blaise to the boy on the other side of the door, "be a close male companion to - sorry - for them, and do what you do to set them straight on that point, would you? There's a good chap." And he hurriedly closed and latched the door before spinning about and grinning like a loon.

With the door finally closed Harry and the other three boys on the floor were howling with laughter and occasionally getting kicked by one of the girls; who were still trying not to laugh.

"Who..." chuckled Harry. "Who - was that?"

"Sixth year male Ravenclaw prefect," Blaise replied with a smug smirk and a shrug. "Roger Davies, I think."

"That was Rog?" exclaimed Harry. "Oh, Merlin! He's going to be pissed with me when we get back. I'm going to have to invite him to the wedding by way of apology."

It didn't stop him laughing about it, though.</pre>

<pre>Everything came crashing down forty-two years after Harry defeated Voldemort; the entire Muggle world found out about the wizarding world. At first, it wasn't a problem; there was an exchange of knowledge, eradication of disease, end to terrorist groups; many of humanity's problems seemed to be solved. Hermione was ecstatic that her two worlds were working together, the purebloods were happy that witches and wizards were respected and held in awe, the poorer wizarding families had new sources of income as they helped Muggles, basically, everyone was stoked. Everyone, that is, except Harry.

Harry knew that it was too good to last, whether they knew it or not, the witches and wizards were being taken advantage of and due to the Muggles' superior numbers and technological advancements, the wizarding world was basically at their mercy. He had never been more sorry to be proven right.

It only took a year for the first group of wizards to band together and rebel; they had been in charge of magically powering generators for 'clean energy' and when they tried to quit, they were told they weren't allowed. Twenty-seven Muggles and nine wizards died that day. Everything went downhill from there.

Naturally, almost every witch and wizard sided with their fellow magic-users and also quit helping the Muggles, they tried to go back to their secluded lives. The Muggles didn't take too kindly to this, they liked their new workforce. Two months later, after many fights between wizards and their Muggle employers, the United Nations declared that witches and wizards posed too great a threat to the Honorable Citizens of Planet Earth to be allowed to run free. So, they imposed a mandatory registration of everyone magical, taking DNA samples as they went for 'research' purposes.

Then the real rebellion began, it started in America and spread across the globe; offices were trashed, records burned, labs destroyed, and the witches and wizards went into hiding again. But now that the Muggles knew what the wizards were capable of, they were hunted.

With what was left of the DNA samples, some scientists identified what they called the 'magic gene' or MG. They then developed an airborne biological weapon which only targeted those who carried the MG, both dominant and recessive. Millions of people died before the magical community figured out how they were being attacked, bubblehead charms were the only refuge.

Over those next few months, Harry felt his body die over and over again, and every time his patience grew thinner and his anger stronger. Who were these people to decide who lived and who died? They were murdering innocent children as well as people who couldn't even do magic because they had the recessive gene.

Harry led the next attack against the plant that produced the chemicals. But by then, the Muggles were waiting for them, the attacking witches and wizards were mowed down by machine guns whose bullets were coated in anti-magic gel. That night, Harry died five times before he managed to blow up the entire complex, everyone who came with him was dead before they even saw who was firing at them.

Harry spent the next month on 'suicide' missions, taking out biochemical plants and military bases but it was too late to make much of a difference.

A week later, every person involved in the Wizard Extermination Project or WEP, was brutally murdered and Harry James Potter was the most wanted person on Earth. After having been 'killed' nineteen times in front of witnesses, everyone knew that he couldn't die and the sentence was an eternity in prison, but he wouldn't be caught because he was Harry Potter and just cool like that.

Three months later, Harry was the last magical person alive and he wished he was dead. But thanks to a certain alchemist, he couldn't even commit suicide. So, he went into hiding for the next seventy years while the toxic (to him alone now) gases dissipated; it wasn't exactly comfortable to die of chemical poisoning multiple times a day.

When he finally emerged from his self-imposed exile, much to his amusement, Harry Potter was still at the top of the most wanted list. It was depressing to know that he was the last of his kind around but Harry was smart enough to know that there was nothing he could do about it now. However, he would always have a great dislike for scientists (especially biochemists), doctors who violated the Hippocratic Oath, and anyone in any position of government or military authority.</pre>

<pre>"Bees! Bees! The bees are after me!" shouted Gabriel laughing at the rather annoyed group of Hufflepuff seventh year girls who were out for blood.

Gabriel had poked them one too many times with his spoon, which they quickly learned was enchanted to shrink their skirts each time they were poked.

Sirius did have to stare when he saw what he originally thought was a skirt on Gabriel though.

"DAMMIT GABRIEL! PUT ON SOME PANTS AND PUT THAT KILT AWAY!" shouted Severus covering his eyes.

"Why isn't she deducting points for wearing a skirt?" asked Sirius out loud.

Surprisingly McGonagall heard him.

"Far be it for me to tell a student they can't wear a kilt," she said evenly. And it was a kilt, not a skirt. She could tell the difference.

"A kilt?" said Sirius incredulous.

"Oh dear lord..." said Severus spotting what Gabriel was enlarging as he ran, not even out of breath. He handed Narcissa some ear plugs before Gabriel started playing bagpipes. McGonagall raised an eyebrow when she saw the pipes, but it quickly turned to understanding when she heard Gabriel play.

His technique was atrocious. She couldn't let this affront to her Scottish heritage continue.

She grabbed him by the ear and dragged him to her office for two hours.

"Well?" asked Severus.

Gabriel was a bit shell shocked.

"She said that she would ignore the minor pranks so long as I agree to take lessons on how to play the pipes during our shared free time on the weekends. Apparently the fact that one of her students was willing to pay homage to her heritage amused her... that and she knew we only had one year left before we were no longer her problem," said Gabriel.

Actually she said that she had decided to bow out gracefully in trying to keep them in line, since they would soon be out of her hair forever. Gabriel didn't have the heart to tell her that she would soon have to deal with the Weasly twins in a little over a decade.

Besides, annoying people with the bagpipes was a fun hobby in his opinion, and he did like McGonagall as a teacher, despite the headaches he gave her.

Plus it gave him all the excuse he needed to wear a kilt even to class. They couldn't complain with McGonagall on the staff after all, and if he were hit with water it wouldn't look nearly as strange.

+

"MR. BLACK! MR. POTTER! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!" shouted Dumbledore.

"Quidditch. Considering we're all sick and tired of playing in the rain we figured the Great Hall was a good second choice," said Gabriel.

Actually they were crossing off another item on The List.

So far they had managed to knock off twenty of the items before the second month was out.

Most of the teachers had figured out that this was the two groups last hurrah before graduating. Which was the only reason they weren't in detention until hell froze over.

It was easier to let them get it over with and see them gone for good than to try and stop it.

+

"You guys up for the prank with the lower years?"

"You mean that muggle fad called a flash mob?" asked James.

Gabriel had explained the concept, and the Marauders thought it was harmless enough to do.

McGonagall wouldn't like it though.

It started innocently enough. Every boy in the great hall below fifth year stood up on the table and began to sing. It took the female teachers less than a minute to realize what they were singing before they quickly tried to hex everyone quiet.

That took them fifteen minutes to get the boys to stop singing "A Wizard's staff has a knob at the end". And like Gabriel predicted, McGonagall was not amused.

Thankfully the boys had been sworn to secrecy on which group convinced them to sing that particular song.

They all got detention just the same though.

+

Flitwick had a headache. And he blamed the two prankster groups.

Someone had posted a sign on the entrances to the library stating that it was closed for an indefinite period of time, and while that made Madam Pince pleased since it meant she wouldn't have to track down her precious books, it annoyed his ravens greatly. It had taken them two hours just to find a way to break the enchantment on the doors to let the students in.

To top it all off, someone had convinced the first years to sing the song that never ended.

It had taken the teachers five cauldrons of migraine relievers before they could convince them to stop.

So yes, his day and possibly his week was now shot. Thank god Christmas was around the corner.</pre>

<pre>“We are going to talk, later, about you spending the whole evening with my daughter,” Jean said, avoiding the question temporarily.

Harry looked amused.  “Do you want a few seconds to think about what you just said?”

Jean opened his mouth and then shut it again, while Aimée laughed softly.

“She is still my daughter.”

“And my Mate,” Harry pointed out.  “Or she will be soon.”  He smiled lightly.  “But if it makes you feel better, we can do all that stuff anyway.  You can grill me about my prospects, and I’ll lie through my teeth and pretend I’m not trying to get into her knickers.”

“A curious phrase,” Aimée interrupted.  “I take it has lost something in translation?”

Harry frowned as he went back over his last words.  “Oh, yes, somewhat.  In English, the implication is not that I would be wearing them, but would have unfettered access to what they normally contain.”

“Ahh,” Aimée said with a nod.  “I see.  But please, don’t let me interrupt your testosterone contest with Jean.”</pre>

Harry also needed a firm elbow in his ribs to silently remind him that a proper fake boyfriend doesn't ogle his real girlfriend's cracking arse as she walks away from him...at least not as long as he is sitting next to his fake girlfriend.</pre>

<pre>"James, Lilly, Dumbledore," came the low voice of Remus Lupin, "the watchman's been relieved by Shacklebolt, and Tonks, Moody, and Vance have taken up guard duties on the minimum and maximum wings."

"Excellent work, both of you. Shall we continue?" He felt the invisibility cloak get pulled off of him as they moved into Azkaban, and he could feel the ancient, immensely powerful wards rush over him. He stifled a humoured smirk when the huge fortress searched him for a mind, and upon finding none, as it was hidden behind his impenetrable magical wall, granted him Dementor privileges. It wasn't part of the plan, but it sure as hell made things far, far easier. "This is where May will be staying," Dumbledore finally announced when they came to a stop, and Harry took note of the measly soul-sucking pressure around him.|</pre>

<pre>The physical training regimen that Roger Granger had set up was breathtaking in an entirely literal sense. The three had been roused early that morning by a retired SAS drill sergeant, who led them on a three-mile run, which they then unhappily learned was just the warm up. Calisthenics, push-ups, crunches and a second, even longer, run followed. Any resentment the three might have held towards Roger for finding such a sadistic taskmaster to train them was countered by the fact that he and his wife were suffering right along with them. It also helped that Roger had arranged for a full-time massage therapist to set up shop across the street to work out at least some of their aches and pains.

"Well, you better hope you can run faster than a hex," Hermione replied, "because you certainly can't drive faster than one."

"Why would he bother driving away from a hex?" Harry asked. "With all his experience he'd be better off crashing into it."

"Oy, don't start that again," Ron complained. "It's not my fault muggles put curves in their roads."

Hermione sprayed her butterbeer as Harry broke out into a hearty laugh.</pre>

<pre>"Well, all our champions are ready for the third task, which will start on my command. Due to certain… unexpected difficulties, the original third task had to be reconsidered. At one point it was going to be a race through a magical maze, but instead, to decide our ultimate Triwizard champion we are going to conduct we are going to conduct that most challenging of tasks… A round of Parchment, Stone, Wand, Dragon, Merlin."

Harry blinked. Seriously? In his time at Hogwarts he had witnessed dozens of games of Parchment, Stone, Wand, Dragon, Merlin, which always took hours because the Purebloods always picked the same thing for several rounds until it occurred them that it wasn't working.

"For the benefit of the Muggle raised in the audience," Bagman continued, "Playing the game is perfectly simple. Wand cuts Parchment," he explained pantomiming the actions. "Parchment covers stone. Stone crushes dragon. Dragon eats Merlin. Merlin snaps Wand. Wand stuns dragon. Dragon burns Parchment. Parchment confuses Merlin. Merlin vanishes stone. And, of course, stone breaks Wand."

"What was that again?" Harry asked, wondering if he could get the fraud to repeat himself.

"Of course, It's very simple. Wand cuts Parchment," he explained, again pantomiming the actions. "Parchment covers stone. Stone crushes dragon. Dragon eats Merlin. Merlin snaps Wand. Wand stuns dragon. Dragon burns Parchment. Parchment confuses Merlin. Merlin vanishes stone. And, of course, stone breaks Wand."

"Ok," Harry nodded. "Got it."

--+

"And Viktor Krum of Durmstrang has cast Merlin, Fleur Delacour of Beauxbatons has also cast Merlin, Cedric Diggory of Hogwarts has Cast Merlin," Bagman announced for the crowd. "And Harry Potter of Hogwarts has cast…"

Silence filled the air as Bagman and everyone else gaped at Harry's offering.

"Parchment!" Bagman gasped. "In a totally unorthodox play, Potter did not cast Merlin, rather casting Parchment, which as everyone knows confuses Merlin. Potter wins the Triwizard Tournament!"

Harry looked to the other champions.

"You didn't cast Merlin," Fleur said, obviously stunned.

"No," Harry agreed. "I didn't."

"But… but…" Viktor stuttered. "You didn't cast Merlin."

"Everyone casts Merlin," Cedric insisted.

"I didn't," Harry pointed out.

"But everyone cast Merlin," the trio chorused.</pre>

<pre>"What's our aurors name?" Percy asked.

Hecate looked at the note they were given, "Nymphadora Tonks. Gods, the poor girl. Which mother would ever name their child such a thing?"

Percy chuckled, "yeah. Let's see," Percy walked to the nearest Auror's desk, a tall man with blonde hair that was white near his temples. He was looking over a file when Percy cleared his throat grabbing his attention, "ah, excuse me sir, can you tell me where I can find officer Nymphadora Tonks?"

The blonde aurora raised an eyebrow, "why do you want to know where the rookie is?"

"Well I'm here for my animagus registration and she's my assigned auror," Percy explained.

The blonde man looked Percy up and down clearly not impressed, "rrright. Sure. Look we don't mind Tonks bringing her boy toys to work, but there is such a thing as personal integrity. Tell your girlfriend that next time you two make out."

Percy blinked, "dude….seriously, what the hell? I'm not her boyfriend, I'm just here to-"

"-Yes yes, I know, you are here to 'register' an animagus form," the wizard used air quotes as he rolled his eyes, "she's three desk down and to the left. And if I catch you two playing hookie I will have her fired, got that?"

Percy blinked as he walked away saying nothing. He turned to Hecate, "what was that?"

"Can't really blame him, seeing someone so young attempting to become an animagus is a big thing, let alone actually succeeding."

"But the way he acted! I'm mean shit, he must hate this woman's guts! Just who is this Nymphadora?!"

"Who the hell said my name?!" a cry came out. Suddenly a witch with short bright pink hair came running out of her desk looking around with an angry growl, "come out right now and I won't hurt you!"

Percy and Hecate blinked. "Huh….well that's new," Hecate commented as she looked the witch over, "I didn't think I would ever find a witch with actual style."

Percy nodded, "yeah," he could help but stare at the way the auror was dressed. The pink hair alone made her stand out, not to mention the leather straps around her wrist and the tight fitting clothes that looked skin tight.

"Excuse me, are you auror Nymphadora?" Percy asked.

The witch looked at Percy and blinked, "ah, yeah. But please, call me Tonks. I don't much like my first name."

Percy shrugged, "can't blame you on that."</pre>

<pre>"Yeah, I'm stopping him."

By that point though, it was too late for the door. It was a pretty destructive piece of magic. There really was nothing left of that door by the end of it and just as Wizard Lenin had predicted, Aunt Petunia had started screaming.

"Too late." Wizard Lenin sounded awfully smug about that statement.

"Yo, guy at my door, hey!" Lily called out to the man. His head swiveled up to meet hers. "Can you not blow up my house for two seconds? I assume you want to talk about the letter."

Squinting in the sunlight, he caught sight of her on the roof and staggered back into the front yard accompanied by the crescendo of Aunt Petunia's panicking shrieks which were growing less intelligble by the minute.

"Eleanor Potter?" he asked, sounding almost incredulous.

"And how my I help you today, kind sir?"

She gave him a slight bow, the hand with the letter sweeping across the shingles of the roof, and offered him a bright grin.

"What are you doing up there?!" he asked sounding panicked, not even paying attention to Aunt Petunia who had come running out of the house with a frying pan aimed at his head.

Lily, for her own part, was walking towards the edge of the roof, preparing to jump down with the aid of a glitch in the form of lessened gravity, a trick that had turned out to be very useful when needing to get down from high places as well as look flashy. So it was only as she floated down from the roof that she offered a warning to the man. "Watch your head."

He didn't, so by the time Lily's bare feet touched ground, he was out cold, and Aunt Petunia was hysterically attempting to grab her and drag her inside.

"Still going well?" Lily asked Wizard Lenin, almost feeling him smile in response.

"I'm entertained."

With a raised hand a bit of concentratio,n the door remembered its prior, not destroyed, state and Aunt Petunia found herself back in the kitchen where she had been previously with only vague recollections that something unpleasant had occurred. The man remained unconscious on the ground.

Lily nudged him with a bare foot, causing him to twitch slightly and then groan. "Come on, it was Aunt Petunia. I'm sure she didn't hit you that hard."

At that, the man attempted to roll over but became nauseous from it, turning from the sickly white color to a curious green. At Wizard Lenin's suggestion, she backed up a safe distance so that when he vomited, it wasn't on her feet.

"Did… You were on the roof." he groaned out, rubbing his head and looking altogether miserable.

"Yes, and you were at the door. But that's irrelevant now. I'm afraid I wasn't quite sure how this owl to mail business thing worked and did not send in my letter on time. That's why you're here, isn't it?"

He nodded slowly, closing his eyes and taking deep breaths, probably still feeling somewhat dizzy. He seemed incapable of too much talking.

"Oh goody. My answer is yes. I would love to attend your glitch academy."

He nodded again, eyes still closed. "Good… that's good."

He attempted to get himself in a sitting position then, which again turned him slightly green. But he persevered and did not vomit twice.

"…The roof… You were on the roof… How did… How did you get down?"

Lily sighed. "I walked."</pre>

<pre>Harry's eyes were watering, and he had to battle an increasing urge to blink with every passing second. Finally, he sighed and looked away, taking off his glasses to wipe his face on a sleeve. He had to swallow his pride and do it.

"I—I am sorry, Crookshanks. I said your name was stupid and called your entire existence pointless... That was wrong of me. For a ginger furball, you're pretty awesome."

Padma giggled at Harry's pained expression, but Hermione was frowning. "What about ruining his cot?"

Harry tilted his head. "I never did that."

Hermione growled. "I swear, one day I'm going to get the truth out of you and smack you so hard..." She seemed to deflate. "At least you recognize how smart he is. Isn't that great, Crookshanks?"

Harry nodded. "Smarter than Weasley, at the very least. Hey, I should get him something as thanks. How about five cans of tuna?"

"Mrrow," said Crookshanks, raising his head.

Harry rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Then again, your efforts might be worth ten."

The cat jumped out of Hermione's hands and walked up to Harry, then leaped into his lap. Angling its head upwards, it let out a purr.

"I see a familiar's loyalty is cheap," Harry said with a grin.

"Turncoat," Hermione muttered. "Just shut up and pet him, Harry."

"Fine," Harry said, "but he better not give me fleas."

Crookshanks looked insulted at that, but was soon purring loudly as he was scratched behind the ears. This wasn't so bad, although Harry wasn't looking forward to cleaning all the orange fur off his robes.

He glanced down at the cat, then at the girl opposite as something occurred to him. "Heh. Hermione, I'm petting your hairy pussy."

An incredulous silence descended upon the compartment. Hermione looked speechless, her face reddening as she reached for her wand. Then there was a muffled snicker, and everyone turned to see Su hide behind her book, her small shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

The unusual sight sent Harry over the edge and he laughed uproariously, Crookshanks jumping off him with an annoyed meow. His laughter quickly changed into yelps of pain when Hermione started throwing stinging hexes. Tony merely scooted away and laughed at the spectacle like the traitor he was.

+

"Still, you're never going to achieve your dreams if you stay cooped up in your room all the time," Sirius continued.

A look of dawning realization passed over Harry's face. He glanced at the screen longingly, then turned back to Sirius. "Fine," he said with a sigh.

The older man blinked. "That's what finally worked? You must be pretty serious about your dreams—let's hear them."

"The usual, I guess. Graduate with good grades, make lots of money..." He ducked his head and mumbled, "Get a harem."

Sirius chortled and clapped his godson on the shoulder. "Ah, youth. Take it from me, Harry: you are rich, famous, and"—he tilted his head and frowned—"not completely ugly."

Harry slapped his hand away. "Oi!"

Sirius raised his hands. "Don't worry, kid, few are born with looks as great as mine. Point is, you can have a different girl on your arm every week when you're older."

"Cool," Harry said. "But I want, y'know, a proper harem where the girls are happy to share me."

Sirius knit his brows. "That sounds like too much trouble. Besides, every girl wants to feel like she's special."

"No, look, it's all scientific," Harry said with a note of frustration. "The more people you add to the love polygon, the softer the corners become, and less painful it is for everyone involved."

Sirius shook his head. "That's it, we're getting you outside right now."

+

Harry was rudely awakened from his dream by a most unholy noise. He fumbled for his glasses and looked around the orange bedroom blearily. Soft light of dawn filtered through the drawn curtains. Hermione stood next to his camp bed, a spoon and a pan in her hands. Seeing that he was awake, she turned to Ron and started banging the pan again.

"Get up," she said. "We'll be late for the Portkey!"

Ron groaned. "Bloody hell, woman! Ever heard of knocking?"

"I have been knocking for five minutes—come on!"

Harry dropped back onto the mattress and covered his head with a pillow. "Hermione, stop doing that, or I won't accept you into my harem."

"What?" The noise halted, then resumed with increased intensity. "I don't want to be in your stupid harem!"

He threw the pillow in Hermione's direction and rose from the bed.</pre>

<pre>Harry's heart was hammering in his chest, and he took a deep breath to try and calm down. What was he so afraid of—Dementors? Please, they were kind of creepy, but he had seen scarier shit online. Granted, they were supposed to have an aura of doom, but he couldn't really feel it when he observed the black figures from the safety of the castle.

The wardrobe doors shot open, and a stunning young woman clad in a skimpy maid outfit stepped outside. She was inhumanly beautiful, with slanted eyes, pointy ears, and a breathtaking figure. The girl stared straight at Harry and tossed her head, smooth blonde hair cascading down her back. There was a collective gasp from the boys in the classroom, and Harry himself gulped at the sight.

"Harry," the vision spoke in a sultry voice, leaning forward and nearly spilling out of her frilly dress. "I want you to listen to me very carefully."

"Uh huh," he said, completely forgetting where he was.

"I am not real," she said. "I won't ever be real. Do you understand?"

He looked up, staring into her empty eyes in horror. "No..."

"Your dream is juvenile and meaningless," she told him, walking forward while swaying her hips. "There is no magic that will help you cross the barrier between 2D and 3D."

Those cruel words cut into his heart, yet Harry couldn't shut his ears to her melodious voice. His eyes roved over her elfin features and the well-endowed figure, not being able to look away from this perfect, unattainable vision.

Unattainable... yet standing an arm's reach away.

"You claim that the barrier cannot be crossed," he said, the corners of his lips twitching upwards, "but you just did, didn't you?"

He stepped forward and the girl moved back, an alarmed expression flitting over her face.

"Y-your favorite anime is shit," she tried.

Harry laughed, advancing and extending his hands towards the pointy-eared maid. He was going to verify just how real this illusion was.

The Boggart backtracked towards its cabinet, turning blurry around the edges. As Harry drew closer, it suddenly changed form into a mummy, then a giant spider, then a vague tentacled thing, too quickly for Harry to get scared; finally, it became a cloud of smoke which rushed into the closet, the double doors slamming shut on their own.

There was a stunned silence in the room. Harry remained still, staring into the distance until the sound of Professor Lupin clearing his throat brought him back to reality.

"Er... you didn't use the spell I taught you, Harry, but well done nevertheless," Remus said. "Hermione, step forward whenever you're ready."</pre>

<pre>There was a postscript at the end.

Do feel free to bring a date. I'll be bringing one and she's very interested in meeting you, Professor.

Dumbledore figured that he should call in Severus and say that the search was over because Harry agreed to meet with them.

He had plans to make, he knew that Gellert was going to make his move soon. It was imperative that Harry defeat him, it was his destiny.

'Gellert,' Albus thought as he shook his head. What was that Dark Lord's name again? 'Riddle….Tom Riddle…yes him.'

Perhaps...perhaps he should retire, he'd nearly forgotten who the current dark lord was. Perhaps he should retire for the greater good of his own mental health. After all, Gellert had already been defeated.</pre>

He dodged a return stun, slammed the door, locked it and screamed, "MANGEUR DE MERDE, ER, MORT!! DEATH EATERS!! AU SECOURS!! BEELL!! MOLLEE!! ARTHUR!!</pre>

"I swear there's frost on the walls outside our common room," complained Ernie, as the Crest members assembled in Room 4J. "Hannah slipped over and banged her elbow so she might be a bit late."

"Don't exaggerate. It's not that cold down there," smirked Susan. "Hannah just tripped over an upturned floor slab."

Ernie went over and poked the fire for a bit, faking a few shudders and grumbling that the stonework outside the Hufflepuff common room had always been fine.</pre>

<pre>When he entered the classroom, Snape wasted no time taking a potshot at Harry.

"Well if it isn't the local felon. Decided to attend class today Potter?" Harry knew that a reply would only incite further consequences so he moved past the professor and took his seat. "No reply today Potter? It seems you would know how to answer questions having plenty of experience in the last week." Harry's eyes instantly met Snape's, but he still made no reply.

"Just stay quiet Harry." He nodded. Eventually the Potions Professor moved to the front of the class and wrote a list of ingredients. With a quick "Begin." the students moved to the class cabinets. The real highlight of the class came about fifteen minutes later as Snape approached his second favorite target, Neville.

"Longbottom, what did you just do?! The professor stomped towards Neville with a fling of his coat.

BOOM! The meek Gryffindor's cauldron exploded which wasn't in itself an odd occurrence. The truly magnificent thing, at least in Harry's opinion, was the fact the cauldron exploded precisely as Snape leaned over it in order to yell at Neville. Thus concluding the greatest potions class ever as decided by the students of fifth year Gryffindor House.</pre>

<pre>"I'm surprised Harry, I thought you would be asking question after question about Voldemort the minute you arrived." Sirius grinned as Molly Weasley rounded on him, he knew that she had no authority in this case and would have to acquiesce to at least some information if Harry asked.

"I figured since you all excluded me during the summer that either you would decide to give me something, or I'd ask someone else. Amelia Bones gave me at least part of the picture a few days ago. Said the Order was nearly driving her up the wall." Harry grinned as the members of the 'vaunted' Order of the Phoenix faces went from annoyed to mortified. It was after all not a good idea to anger the Head of the DMLE. She could make your life very difficult.

"Did she say why Harry?" Harry grinned as he remembered the relaying of every way the Order of the Phoenix was making her life difficult. He had also learned a useful spell that day.

"You guys are guarding something in the Department of Mysteries?" Not really a question but more a statement that required confirmation. At the nod from the table, Harry continued, "Did you really think that a visitor to the DoM could just walk in and walk out? Every time a visitor, or anyone without proper clearance goes down there a report has to be filed and verified."

"Director Bones needs to file a report on our actions every time one of us goes down there for guard duty?" A pink haired girl who Harry had learned early was named Tonks asked with a rather pale face, actually it looked like her hair had paled to if that was possible.

"That's right." Harry smiled at the reaction of the room's reaction and filed it away for later use. Amelia had asked him if he ever had the chance to make the Order sweat a bit about what they were doing.</pre>

He beamed proudly at Dumbledore, then turned to the resident ghost.

"I guess we'll be going in. You've been a great help, Myrtle."

She clasped her hands. "If you die, we can share this bathroom, Harry."

He nodded solemnly. "Thank you. If I could touch you, I'd flip up your skirt and peek at your knickers."

"That's... why, that's the sweetest thing a boy has ever told me!" She blushed a deep silvery color and dived head-first into a toilet with a happy eep.

Dumbledore cleared his throat. "I must admit, I don't recall Myrtle ever being so cooperative."

"We have an understanding," Harry said, scratching the back of his neck. He really didn't want to get into the details of what his 'favor' to the ghost girl had been.</pre>

<pre>Harry, though, took the marauder route and chopped two pieces of wood off the dock with a cutting hex. He transformed them into small tubes he attached to his ankles with a sticking charm. Then he cast a banishing spell on the insides that turned the tubes into mini-jets that shot him through the water at high speed. Like last time, he used gillyweed to adapt to underwater. He arrived at the hostages, freed Hermione, and shot back to the shore in well under half-an-hour. Unfortunately, though, he had to wait out the gillyweed's hour-long effect before getting out of the freezing water — that cost him a few points, but not nearly as many as Victor's biting his hostage.</pre>

"It was totally not my fault. They called Hannah not-nice. Wiping them out utterly was the only way to stop her from crying." Harry defended himself.

"He pleads guilty on all charges Your Honor." Hermione sighed. "He also pleads insanity, stupidity, chivalry, pyromania, temporary insanity, bad-hair-day, and 'being Harry'."

The judge gritted his teeth, glaring with his hands twitching in a way as if they wanted to wrap themselves around something neck-sized and squeeze. "The defendant is free to go." He finally ground out, looking as if he wanted nothing more than to draw his wand and hex him into oblivion.

Harry smiled happily up at the man with the hammer before making his way out of the courtroom, humming happily to himself. "Oh, wait, before I forget. I think I heard that Luna is planning on releasing the heliopaths again. Thought you might want to know." He waved cheerfully as both the judge and the jury started screaming hysterically and bolting for cover, whistling contently as he made his way towards where he'd hid his experimental fireworks with a bounce in his step.</pre>

<pre>"That it didn't kill Mr. Potter during the game yesterday was due only to the boy's exceptional flying skills. No fewer than four times did it barely miss smashing his head to paste! But Dobby was your house-elf! How can you say you don't know what the creature was doing? House-elves cannot do anything without permission, we all know that!"

He ploughed on, over the sputtering objections of the other Wizard.

"So we are left with only three possibilities. One, you ordered Dobby to kill Mr. Potter and then told Dobby to lie about it. Two, your son gave those orders, either at your behest or by himself. Or, three, the house-elf is insane."

Malfoy was in a towering rage, his face red and his hands trembling. "How dare you!" he said softly.

"The first two possibilities you categorically deny, but they still need to be stated lest we overlook something!" Gilderoy said in a condescending tone, as if stating an obvious and simple fact.

"By Merlin, YES, I DO DENY!" shouted the Wizard.

"Which means that you had in your possession for months, if not years, an insane house-elf, and you never noticed?"

Malfoy stared at him his fingers twitching towards his wand.

"How could you not notice your house-elf was insane? You are the Lord of your House! You should have noticed! It is your job to notice." The professor paused and posed dramatically, making a fist with his index finger extended and touching his temple. "Unless you couldn't," he said carefully. He dropped his hand to his side.

"I remember reading that you were an unwilling accomplice to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, eleven years ago."

Malfoy was confused at the change of subject, but still enraged. "I was imperiused, you dandified fool," he said vehemently.

"I also heard that you were crucioed several times by Him as punishments for attempting to disobey Him."

Glaring, the other Wizard merely nodded angrily.

"And brutally legilimened."

Another angry nod.

"Well, it's well known fact that too much exposure to the imperious, and you said you were under it almost monthly over a period of several years, can lead to mental problems later on in life. Things like being unable to tell reality from fantasy."

Malfoy's eyes began to bulge and his face turned even redder. He definitely was trembling. His colour reminded Harry of Vernon just before he exploded into violence.

"And the crucio, you testified he crucioed you many times for trying to disobey. And a side effect of crucio is difficulty in keeping one's temper, and allowing one's emotions to over-rule their reason.

"And unless a legilimens is performed with extreme care permanent damage to one's psyche can result. And you said HE wasn't one to care about his followers.

"REDUCTO," screamed Malfoy leaping to his feet, his wand appearing in his hand almost instantly.

As fast as Malfoy was, Harry/Gilderoy was faster — and he had been expecting such an action. Even as h</pre>

<pre>"Well first, can we look at your references. We need contact addresses and numbers. This one for instance, S. Snape - I see he's a teacher. That's excellent. Would he be willing to recommend you?" inquired Radley.

"Well... he did actually hate and revile me for seven long years the bastard but eventually I think I had his respect. Well, not respect exactly. What I mean is he probably hated me for a good reason instead of a bad reason." Harry paused, "I'm not putting this very well am I?"

"Perhaps if I spoke to him? Have you his phone number?" asked Radley.

"Mmm.. Actually ... he's dead. He was attacked by a giant snake." said Harry hesitantly, wondering whether this would be a 'bad' thing to reveal or a 'good' thing.

"Oh ... Kay..." Radley paused then continued, "Don't worry. It's not too uncommon for references to become ... deceased. Let me see now..." he perused the list further.

"Ah! Now I see we have a headmaster here - Professor A. Dumbledore. This is even better. Have you his number?"

"Well... sadly ... he's dead too. Is that bad? Job-prospect-wise I mean?" asked Harry.

"Well it does sort of limit his ability to give you a reference does it not?" there was a slight note of sarcasm in Radley's voice.

"Actually, it might be possible..." Harry thought quickly but decided to play it safe, "No, of course, that does make it difficult."

"I hope he wasn't killed by a giant snake too!" laughed Radley, amused at his own wit.

"No, actually Professor Snape killed him." replied Harry.

"Your first reference killed your second reference. Then he got eaten by a snake?" inquired the official, eyebrows raised a notch.

"No, no. that would be silly wouldn't it?" smiled Harry realizing how that might sound unusual. "He wasn't actually eaten by the snake. It just bit into his neck and left him to die. But Neville cut his head off so it was alright in the end."

"Neville cut off ... Ah! You mean the snake. He cut off the snake's head? For a moment I thought you meant..." he tailed off.

"How about this one, Mr. R. Lupin. Is this right? It says here against 'occupation' that he's a werewolf." continued Radley.

"Well I thought it important to be open and honest about these things but there was no actual box for anthropomorphic activity so..."

"Quite." responded Radley.

"Anyway, he's dead." said Harry. "But it wasn't my fault!" he added hurriedly.

Radley paused, peering over both the document and his glasses which were perilously close to falling off the end of his nose.

"Mr. Potter. It does seem that all your references do seem to end up ... well ... dead to put it bluntly. What about this one - Mr. S. Black - Oh! escaped mass murderer. Tell me, before I even ask..."

"Dead." cut in Harry. "But I did help him escape - the second time that is, not the first time. The first time I wanted to kill him myself real bad. But I didn't. Well, not directly. I mean it was my fault but..."

"What about friends? You must have older school aquaintances who might now be in a professional capacity and might recommend you?"

"Well ... there was Cedric Diggory ... but he's dead. That wasn't my fault either. Well, only a bit."

Radley sighed. "I did notice a mention somewhere else in your CV of a member of the peerage. Let me see... yes, a Lord Voldemort. Now that would be a fine reference!" He hesitated, "He's not erm..."

"Dead." replied Harry. "Sorry, he would never have given me a reference anyway."

"Why not?"

"It was me that killed him." replied Harry, then realized this might sound worse than it actually was, "Well, not actually killed him. You see he attacked me and there was a kind of rebound because... It's complicated." he finished suddenly</pre>

<pre>As Professor Dumbledore pulled his head out of his ash he had a cough drop behind. He bonged his hat on the mantelpiece as he jerked round.

"Ahem! Excuse me, Headmaster, there's a beetle in your hair." It was McGonagall's foot that was crushing his fingers into the hearth. "Have you just been talking to... You-know-who?"

She took a half-pace back but he still felt crowded as he scrambled to his feet then stood up.

Soot spluttered into her face as he replied. "Of course not, I've been talking to Lord Voldemort. Always use the proper name for things, Minerva. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."

"Oh, in that case it's not a beetle, it's a venenacataphractoscorpionem."

"A what?"

"It's a type of magically-armoured poisonous scorpion."

"Aaagh!" Dumbledore danced around to his stock of memories to see if there was anything relevant from his early days. "Why didn't you say so!"

Panicking, he began to smash the most recent recollections to the floor so he could scrabble his numb, withered hand right to the back of the shelves but he could feel nothing there at all.

"I didn't want to alarm you, Albus. Fear of a name—"

"Yes, yes..." He looked in his mirror but all he saw was socks. "Has the wotsit gone?"

"I believe it fell into the Pensieve, Headmaster."</pre>

<pre>Albus nodded. There was another way, of course. Tom was very cautious, but he was still meeting his followers. Severus could carry a bomb with him. Shrunken, he could smuggle it inside. Pull it out, and set it off. The effects of the wards would make triggering it difficult, but not impossible - he had checked. Against anyone else, it would be almost certain to work. But against Voldemort? He knew about bombs, as he had so cruelly demonstrated. He was used to treachery, and would expect it. And he was one of the fastest wands Albus knew. Not even Filius was as quick. Would he be able to vanish or transfigure the bomb before it detonated?

Probably. Albus knew he could do the same, after all. He had tested it, just in case a friend of his fell victim to the Imperius, and Voldemort decided to use this ploy on the Headmaster.

Besides, while the death of Voldemort would be a likely fatal blow to his current campaign, it would be temporary. Only Harry could kill the Dark Lord for good. So far, things had not been as dire as to necessitate such a risky plan. But, the Headmaster added, with a glance at the drawer the report was now resting in, he might find himself in a situation where he'd have to ask Severus to sacrifice himself for such a chance sooner than expected.

He looked at Severus, sitting there, stiff and tense. If Albus asked him to, he would do it. Gladly even.

Guilt was a powerful force. Almost as strong as love. Albus knew that very well. Very well indeed.</pre>

<pre>As they were finishing, the door opened. "Miss Granger..." McGonagall stood on the threshold with a shocked expression matched only for depth by Snape's thunderous look over her shoulder. "What in Merlin's name do you think you are doing?"

"Potionsth lessthon, Professor," said Hermione, her hand as steady as a rock as she stoppered the vials. "They're fine," she said to the boys but they had shrunk down into their seats hoping nobody would notice them.

McGonagall's lips made a very thin line that could cut through glass. "Your Potions lesson is down in the dungeon as you very well know. This prank will earn each of you detention which–"

"–Appello," cut in Hermione. "I wish to appeal on the grounds that according to the Founders Rules and Regulations, a Hogwarts lesson is defined as any class given by a qualified teacher at Hogwarts."

"Precisely. And your qualified teacher is Professor Snape. You will immediately–"

"Appello. Mister Snape is not officially qualified so–"

"And you are, I suppose! ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE!" bellowed Snape, striding past McGonagall. "You will address me as 'Sir' or 'Professor' and–"

"–Appello. Yes, I am qualified and have the certificate handed to me personally by Madame Marchbanks at the Ministry to prove it, whereas you, Mister Snape, are only a Potions Master with no teaching skills whatsoever. Technically you should address me as Professor Granger in front of the students but I'll waive that privilege."

"MISS GRANGER!" cried McGonagall. "I am ordering you to stop this fiasco and in future you will attend normal–"

"–Appello. Anyone who prevents a student from attending a legitimate lesson without good reason will attend a disciplinary hearing before the Hogwarts Board of Governors that–"

"Miss Granger! I am not preventing your – these – students from attending the official Hogwarts Potions lesson that is taking place in the basement, but I am–"

"–Appello. Mr Snape's class is not a legitimate Potions lesson but an indulgence in bad manners at best and child abuse at worst, whereas my class is properly authorised."

"SILENCE!" cried Snape. "I will not tolerate this! Either you immediately–"

"–Appello. To obstruct, divert, or otherwise impede a student who is claiming Appello is itself an offence under Article Thirty-eight and subject to a disciplinary hearing."

"THE – BOARD – WILL – NOT – LISTEN – TO – YOU! Is that clear!" bellowed Snape.

"THEY – HAVE – NO – CHOICE," Hermione stated quite firmly – and rather loudly. "The Board are bound by the Founders' magic in these situations, as are we all."

"Miss Granger," said McGonagall, striving to bring herself under control, "you have no idea how dangerous is the ground on which you tread. I have no choice but to refer this incident to the Headmaster. You are almost certain to face expulsion from Hogwarts unless you conform. You two boys – you will immediately return to Professor Snape's Potions class and serve out any punishment he deems fit."

"Appello," said Ron, his voice wavering only a little.

"Appello," echoed Neville, trying hard to sit up straight.

There was silence for several seconds except for the gentle bubbling of two cauldrons which now caught Snape's attention.

"How dare you steal ingredients and equipment from the stores!"

"–Appello! Article Sixty-four states that direct accusations of crime must never be made without strong evidence, failing which an apology is required. Everything here is purchased by myself and I have the receipts to prove it. The Founders rules demand an apology."

"Demand? I won't stand for this!" He swept forward and began angrily examining potions bottles, packets, and boxes, calming down to a sheepish scrutiny within moments as he realised they had all been supplied by a completely different pharmacy to the one used by Hogwarts. He inspected the contents of the cauldrons which had now thickened and lost colour.

"What is this nonsense being brewed?" He glanced at the blackboard and snorted, "You have it completely wrong and this is not the potion set for today!"

"Appello. The–"

"STOP! STOP THIS NOW!" McGonagall shook her head. "You will all accompany me to the Headmaster's office. He shall decide on a suitable punishment."

Her eyes swept disdainfully around the room then she strode out of the door where she folded her arms and waited. Ron and Neville looked at Hermione and she nodded. As they went out, Snape vanished all the equipment and wiped the blackboard with a few waves of his wand.

"Appello," said Hermione at the doorway. "Destroying evidence and destroying a student's property are both violations of–"

"SILENCE!" cried Snape.

"Appello. A student's legitimate Appello MUST be heard."

Snape groaned in exasperation. "Then let the Headmaster hear it just before he expels you."</pre>

"Write? You mean, like, a letter?" Harry wrinkled his nose. "I just use Skype like a normal person."</pre>

Plastering what he hoped was a friendly smile on his face, Harry ignored its uselessness with the hood covering his head and entered a few paces into the room.

"Good Evening!" The five occupants of the room jumped in surprise and turned towards the sound of the wizard's voice. "I couldn't help but hear your shouting from down the hall and thought I would stop by. Everything alright here?"

Mr. Underhill looked up at the cloaked stranger and narrowed his eyes. "I don't suppose you are another guest Gandalf failed to warn me about. Have you come to help as well?"

Harry tilted his head to the side. "Gandalf?"

"Yeah," one of the other Halflings, Merry, butted in. "You know, reeeealy old, carries a fancy wizard's staff around and knows how to put on a mean fireworks show."

A picture of a grinning Dumbledore preparing to light the fuse of some Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes fireworks with Voldemort strapped to them as the red-headed twins crackled madly in the background suddenly popped up in Harry's mind. Shaking his head, Harry quickly dispelled the disturbing image.

"Err, yes, well I haven't a clue as to who that is. No, I am just a curious passerby trying to keep the peace in any way that I can."</pre>

Harry smiled a little sheepishly. "We are. In completely unrelated news, I have now been banned from brewing potions in the dorm room."

Ron rolled his eyes. "Harry will also be sleeping on a couch in the Common Room until he manages to fix his bed."

"Or bribes a House Elf to do it for him," Seamus said.

Dean elbowed him. "Don't give him ideas."

"If he hadn't already had it, I'll eat my hat."

"I hadn't," Harry piped up. He was smiling brightly in a manner that suggested he was lying, but Hermione wasn't going to call him out if it meant she would get to see Seamus actually eat his hat.

"I don't believe you," Seamus said flatly.

"You just don't want to follow through," Neville scoffed. "Now are we going to breakfast or what?"

"No, thank you. Soda please." She certainly wouldn't drink alcohol on a mission.

"Suit yourself." He tossed her a soda, ensuring she'd have to wait until she could open it, and grabbed the whiskey for himself. After one sip he frowned. "Are they allowed to serve this to their guests?"

"You picked the hotel." Hermione grinned.

"I did." He huffed, but didn't put the bottle away. "So…" He leaned forward. "... tell me how the dates went, hm?"

She narrowed her eyes. "That's none of your business."

"But… I need to know. Harry's my responsibility. How can I teach him how to improve when I don't know what he did wrong?"

"What makes you think he did anything wrong?" Hermione huffed.

"Well, he's not asking me for advice on how to properly satisfy a witch."

Hermione rubbed her forehead. The worst thing was that she couldn't tell if Sirius was actually being serious or not.

Harry wasn't quite certain what he should be feeling about the fact that, apparently, only the threat of genocide kept the peace between goblins and humans.</pre>

<pre>That was fine by her. "Good evening, Mister Dumbledore." She leaned against the bar, but tried to keep an eye on the rest of the room. Martin might not be as observant as he usually was. "Last night, two Aurors came by."

"As every night," Dumbledore said. The old wizard was even polishing glasses with his wand while talking to her, as if he was a character in a cliched novel.

"They disappeared shortly after leaving here," Brenda said. "You're the last ones to have seen them."

"Really? They disappeared?" The owner of the pub shook his head. "I didn't notice anything suspicious when they left here."

She hadn't even asked him a question yet, and he was already stalling her. "Did any of your guests pay special attention to them?"

The old man shrugged. "I'd not know. I respect the privacy of my guests. They come here to enjoy a pint or two in peace, not to be spied on."

"And they certainly don't have anything to hide," Brenda said in the most sarcastic tone she could manage.

"Exactly." The man's smile was just this side of patronising.

Brenda controlled herself though. "We suspect that muggleborns are behind this disappearance. Did you see any around?"

"How would I be able to tell a muggleborn from a pureblood? It's not as if there's a difference." The old wizard shrugged. Before she could say anything, he went on, with an insolent grin: "Nor do I care about people's parents. I'm breeding goats, not purebloods, you know."

Martin hissed next to her, but her partner managed to control himself. Brenda let the implied insult wash over her. She stared at the man. "How many guests do you think will keep visiting if we start to pay close attention to them?"

To her annoyance, he snorted. "See, that's the kind of threat and petty bullying that makes Aurors so popular among the people." Dumbledore's brother shook his head. "Maybe if you acted less like thugs, and more like Aurors should act, people would see and remember more when you ask for help."

Brenda hissed through clenched teeth: "If you're protecting the muggleborns doing this, then that will end badly for you. Very badly."

"Is this another threat? Are trying to tell me that you'll try to frame me for a crime if I don't act as your snitch?" The old wizard stopped smiling, and Brenda found herself fighting the urge to take a step back when he glared at her.

"Do you think your brother will protect you?" She knew the two Dumbledore brothers were not on speaking terms.

He scoffed. "Do you think I need his protection? Girl, I may not be my brother, but I fought Grindelwald, and lived." He glared at her, and Brenda shuddered, taking a step back from the sheer amount of hatred he displayed. "And I'm rather sick of this blood purity hogwash. Now get out of here! This inn is no place for Death Eaters, whether they wear black or red robes!"

That insult made Brenda angry enough to stand up to the old wizard. "Are you calling me a Death Eater?"

"That's the wrong question, girl. The question you should ask is: What difference is there between an Auror and a Death Eater for a muggleborn?" The old wizard had stopped polishing glasses with his wand, but hadn't put it away. A fact of which Brenda was very aware. And she noticed that the room had fallen silent once again. She didn't need to glance around to know that there were more wands ready.

Lifting her chin, she turned around and headed to the door. This visit hadn't gone as she had hoped.</pre>

<pre>Harry took a deep breath. "So… that's why my parents died? Why he is so fixated on me? Why he needed my blood to revive himself?"

Albus smiled gently, and nodded. "To be precise, Tom's belief in the prophecy is what drove him to attack your family. He didn't need your blood to be resurrected; he chose it so he would be immune to the protection your mother had granted you."

"The blood protection," Harry said.

Albus nodded. He didn't know what Lily Potter had done to protect Harry. All her notes had been lost - or deliberately destroyed. He had his suspicions, of course. Harry thought, like most of Britain, that it was his mother's love that had protected him. From a certain point of view, that was correct. Lily's love for Harry had driven her to take such measures. And it wouldn't do to let Britain know that the Boy-Who-Lived had most likely been protected by highly-illegal blood magic.</pre>

<pre>Lee Jordan stood on a raised section at one edge of the pitch, his voice came clear over the din of the cheering crowd. If Hermione didn't know better - and the ceiling weren't obvious - she might have think they were at a real Hogwarts match.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" he cried. "This top secret match, sanctioned by the still-to-be-named organisation and clearly organised to spite the hateful, malevolent She-Who-Could-Be-Named-But-Then-I-Would-Have-To-Wash-My-Mouth-With-Dragon-Sweat…., is between a pair of old rivals…as old as the school. On one side, the Hufflepuff warriors, determined and ready to win! On the other, the courageous, powerful Ravenclaws ready to claw their way to victory! Let's hear it for them, folks!"

Cheers arose at both announcements. Hermione marvelled at the number of students gathered around the pitch. There were no proper stands, but the ground was soft enough for them to sit and watch. Hermione's eyes flowed around the mess of players above. They hadn't begun, but each team was warming up its players - a slight departure from the norm that the captains had insisted upon. After all, neither team had ever practiced on this pitch.

"Alright, it looks like the honourable, venerable and generously entitled Angelina Johnson is stepping to the centre to start the match!" Lee said in a booming voice. "As you all know, telling any professor about the events in this location is not a good idea, so, we have chosen a third-party to the match to oversee the rules. Each captain will administer a match for other teams this year, so long as Quidditch is banned by Her Royal Dung-ness, of course. Angelina is just a better gobstones player than Marcus Flint, and thus won today's honour.

"You are the worst thing to ever befall this school," Harry spat, his teeth forming hisses and spits. He nearly smiled as her face turned to confusion. She had clearly not expected him to speak Parseltongue.

"You need to wash your mouth out, Potter," she said. "Spouting gibberish! Five detentions, to be carried out with me, personally."

"He banged his head, you-" Fred began, ending with a swiftly adjusted, "pride of the Ministry, you."</pre>

<pre>"That still leaves the fact that two dozen students were hurt at your school. And that you had to lock up the students to prevent more violence," Amelia said.

It was a parting shot, nothing more. He shrugged. "No one was seriously hurt, as I said before, and the culprit has left the school. Lessons will resume tomorrow, though the staff will keep a close watch on everyone."

And Albus and Filius would be analysing this map, so they could help Remus and Sirius duplicate it. With Draco and his cohorts gone from Hogwarts, the Dark Lord's followers wouldn't have to risk hurting their own children should they strike at the school. Additional security would be needed.

"The Board of Governors might not share your optimistic view," Cornelius said. "They might consider your handling of this affair inadequate as the Headmaster of Hogwarts."

Albus narrowed his eyes. "Should they do that I might consider their actions as proof of their allegiance with the Dark Lord." Cornelius paled, and Albus glared at Amelia. "I am growing tired of struggling to protect the innocents while remaining within the bounds of laws passed by inept and corrupt people. I would suggest you stop pushing me, before you go too far." Amelia was about to answer him, but he cut her off. "Neither of you know what a real war is like. Ask some of the few remaining British wizards and witches who fought at my side in Grindelwald's War and you might understand why they and all of Europe scoff when you talk of the 'Blood War' twenty years ago that you fear so much. Ask, and then ask yourself if you truly wish to have me as your enemy. For if it comes to it, I will not merely fight you, I will wage war against you as I did against Grindelwald."

He hadn't raised his voice, not much, but Cornelius was cringing, and even Amelia looked shaken.

"Now go and take your Aurors with you, and do not bother me again when you are acting on Voldemort's orders!"

Both left his office, not quite running, but looking remarkably like cowed first years. Albus leaned back in his seat, sighing. He had almost lost his temper, but if Cornelius and Amelia continued on their foolish path… The Headmaster shook his head. He doubted they would actually seek out a veteran of Grindelwald's War. Or if they did, believe his tales. They didn't want to believe just how bad things could become. Not that there were many such veterans left anyway. He imagined the two talking to Aberforth, and snorted. That would be a memorable conversation. To see Aberforth's scorn turned on someone else… He closed his eyes, old pain filling him.</pre>

<pre>"But it's the Wizengamot's place to set laws, as well as judge people, and ours to enforce their laws and sentences. What if we start to ignore any law we don't like? If everyone does it, then the entire system would collapse and there would be no justice anymore!"

He could almost hear Amelia's voice. Albus shook his head. "But there already is no justice anymore. The muggleborns did not deserve to be excluded and persecuted. The system you worry about has already failed." He would remind her that her father, muggleborn himself, was being spared so far because she was an Auror, but that might drive her to feel pressured to obey Amelia's orders even more, to protect him.

"But if that's so, why are you still working within it?" She wasn't quite crying, but the young metamorphmagus was very upset.

He smiled. "I am doing that because I am trying to prevent the Ministry from committing even worse mistakes and crimes. If they continue to hound the muggleborns, far more people will be killed on all sides than if they focus on Voldemort. In politics, as in war, one often has to choose the lesser evil, and make compromises. But there are lines I will not cross. If I am forced to choose between my conscience and the law, then I will choose my conscience, even if it means I will be forced to fight the Ministry." Though he had been hard-pressed not to act when that poor boy had been executed. If he had seen any chance to prevent that… but he hadn't. He nodded slowly. "But there are more ways to fight something than with your wand. You know this, or you would not be spying for the Order."

"The Order hasn't blown up dozens of people," she muttered

"Not in this war at least. Or rather, not yet."

Nymphadora stared at him with wide eyes. He almost chuckled at the sight. "If I knew where the Dark Lord is hiding, or the bulk of his followers, I would arrange such a bombing myself."</pre>

<pre>"So, Harry," Fred said, directly, "what's up?"

Harry gave them a quick recap of what had happened, explaining how the house elf, Dobby, had diverted and trapped him.

"And that was when you Apparated?" Hermione asked, sounding alarmed.

"Yes," Harry said. "I could think of no other way back."

"So, what's the problem?" Fred asked.

"Well…" Harry began, pausing. He looked at the three of them, feeling shame course through him. "I sort of splinched on the way back."

"But," Hermione began, looking at him in alarm. "Did the professors…could they fix whatever…?"

"My suitcase was left behind," he explained.

No one said anything. They just looked at him quizzically.

"The map was in the suitcase," he said after a moment, sinking into himself.

The startled looks from the three were as he expected. "It was a wonderful present," he said, "but I lost it immediately."

"And you couldn't…?" Fred began.

"I don't know where I was," Harry answered. "I don't know if I could make it back there in one piece if I tried…"

"It is a sad loss," George said.

"A loss for mischief makers everywhere," Fred said, bowing low.

"Well," George said after a moment of silence, "when do we begin working on making a new one?"

Harry was startled at how quickly they had jumped to that. "What?" he asked.

"If it could be made once," Fred said, stoically, "it will be made again."

"Have you been all torn up about the map, Harry?" Hermione asked, looking concerned.

"A- a little," he muttered.

The twins and Hermione rolled their eyes.

"You seriously thought we'd care more about the map than you?" Fred asked.

"You're worth at least two maps, Harry," George said. "Maybe three if we can get some market speculation around you…"

"Huh?" Harry asked.

"Hush you," Hermione said to George. She pulled Harry into a hug. "We're glad you are safe, you idiot," she said.</pre>

"How were your holidays?" he asked.

"Good," she said, "quiet. Home feels really easy going after Hogwarts. I got loads of studying done. Oh, and thank you for the book. I read it on Boxing Day."

"Thanks for your gift, too," Harry said. "It was a fascinating read."

"What about our gifts?" Fred called back.

"Mine exploded and threw cream pies in every direction," Harry said.

"And mine chased my parents around the living room bouncing like an out of control pogo stick," Hermione said.

"What's a pogo stick?" Harry asked.

"That's beside the point," Fred said, waving off his question. "How was the creme pie?"

"Delicious," Harry answered, reluctant.

"And the widget we made you," George said, turning back to Hermione, "wasn't it useful when you stopped running from it?"

"I-I guess," she said. "It brings us drinks whenever we want. My father is keeping it in the lounge for guests. He's going to tell them it is the latest in robotics."

"Robotics?" Harry and the twins asked as one.

"Muggle automated devices that do things for you?"

"Muggles do think up some amazing things," Harry said.</pre>

<pre>After the feast and a raucous, off-tune rendition of the school song (the highlight being an older Gryffindor's terrible attempt to rap), they were bid goodnight by the headmaster and led to the Ravenclaw tower by two prefects. One was a skinny and somewhat fidgety boy named Robert Hilliard, and the other a standoffish girl who didn't introduce herself, looking like she'd rather be anywhere else. The trek up the tower wasn't exactly short, and by the time they reached their destination more than one kid was out of breath.

Hilliard pointed at the eagle-shaped knocker on the polished wooden doors. "The entrance to the common room is protected by a password to make sure only house members can enter. Observe."

He knocked once, and a cool voice asked, "Password?"

"Two—Five—C—Hash—Seven—J—X—Zero," Hilliard recited.

"Password approved," the voice said, and the door swung inwards.

"Our house is awesome," Harry breathed.

The first-years exchanged unsure glances, and a black-haired boy Harry vaguely remembered as Michael Corner raised his hand. "Do we have to remember all that?"

"Yes, of course—you there, don't write it down!" Robert jumped towards a girl who had a piece of paper out and seized it, making her jump back in fright. "That would defeat the purpose!"

"Oh, come off it, Hilliard," the female prefect said. "I told you to make the password simple, and here you are with your ridiculous ideas again. We're changing it to 'raven's wit'."

Robert puffed up. "And I told you that passwords like that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. It took Lysander and me less than an hour to break into the Gryffindor common room using an enchanted Webster's Third."

The girl rolled her eyes. "You two are the only idiots in the castle who would waste time on something like that. Come on—raven's wit."

Wilting under his partner's glare, the male prefect nodded and raised his wand. The two of them tapped the bronze knocker on each side and whispered something.

"Password changed," the voice announced.

"Get inside, and I'll show you to your dorms," the female prefect ordered. "We've wasted enough time as it is."

"I thought your password was cool," Harry said as he walked past the dejected-looking Hilliard. The older boy gave him a surprised, yet pleased grin.</pre>

<pre>The grass was frozen, crunching underfoot. But only Mad Eye’s thumping loud footsteps carried through the moonlit night. Once past Hagrid’s hut, and well into the Forbidden Forest, Harry finally dared to ask a question, being careful to keep his voice low.

“So, what’s this all about Professor Moody?”

“We’re going to have a look at what you’ll be facing in the first task Potter,” Moody replied quietly.

“Isn’t that against the rules?” Hermione’s disembodied voice asked. Mad Eye snorted.

“Poppycock! Reconnaissance is all part of the game Granger. The trick is to not get caught by anyone who matters!”

Hermione didn’t really have a response to that. She frowned and stayed close to Harry, one arm around his waist as they crept carefully through the forest together under his invisibility cloak. She jumped with a start, gasping when a nearby roar shook the trees. Harry’s pulse quickened and he gulped.

Moody stopped suddenly, whispering, “Right then, don’t say a word... Just look where I’m pointing. Whaddya see?”

It was so dark in the shadows under the canopy of the forest, that for a moment, Harry and Hermione couldn’t see a thing, but then they made out what looked like a person crouched under some bushes. Whoever it was, their attention was fully engaged on whatever was in the clearing ahead.

“That’s Karkaroff doing his boy’s work for him... Now that’s cheatin.’ If he’d brought Krum with him, that would be training, like I’m doing with you two.”

Mad Eye doubled back through the forest a bit with his two pupils, and then worked around a prickly thicket and a copse of oak-trees to approach the clearing from another direction. The trees shook again from another loud rumble and a flicker of orange light briefly lit up a few near the clearing. Moody stopped and pointed again - this time at two enormous shadowed figures.

“That’s Hagrid and his lady-friend, Madame Maxime,” Mad-Eye whispered, shaking his head with a low chuckle.

“Poor sap doesn’t realise he’s being had... Oh, she likes Hagrid well enough, but she’s also playin’ him so that she can get a look at what’s out here without being taken for a cheater. But again, without her student here, she’s doing all the work instead of givin’ her girl the opportunity to learn a bit about surveilling undercover.”</pre>

“JORDAN,” bellowed Professor McGonagall. “This is a Quidditch match, not Skeeter’s Gossip Column...”

"Ah, young Ares, now that you are here, we can get to the bottom of this," Dumbledore stated, though there was little of his usual joviality.

"Sure, Ol' Albus. I'm happy to help you however I can," Harry said, his tone pitched to be more helpfully polite and earnest than Dumbledore's.

"Young man, you will address the headmaster with his appropriate title." Mcgonagall spoke up her tone icy.

Harry turned to her with a puzzled expression, "Why? Based on how he greeted me, I assumed we were on a first-name basis."

Mcgonagall went white at that comment and pursed her lips into a thin line, all signs Harry had long learned to recognize as ones that she was very displeased.

"Enough," Dumbledore cut across the burgeoning confrontation with a sharp voice, "Mr. Flamel, I assume you know why you're here."

"I have a fairly good idea, Headmaster," Harry responded, turning his focus, back on to Dumbledore, "It's okay though, you don't have to apologize."

"Apologize?" Dumbledore sat back in his chair and was regarding Harry without a trace of amusement.

"Why yes, for me having to defend myself from potentially deadly curses yet again, inside of your school," Harry answered promptly, keeping satisfaction off his face at the confusion that flashed briefly on Dumbledore's expression before being hidden.

Nicholas Flamel was right. Deliberately misinterpreting topics of conversation and discussion with Dumbledore could frustrate the man, especially as it turned some of the man's favorite tactics against him.

"You are here because of the eleven Slytherin students that are in the infirmary at the moment," Dumbledore stated, his expression grim, "I cannot begin to express to you just how serious a situation this is."

Harry just stared at the headmaster, without visible reaction. Another bit of the alchemist's advice coming to him. Never react the way he expects, it makes it so much harder for him to spell you into a corner.

"You have nothing to say for yourself?" Dumbledore asked, leaning forward, steepling his fingers.

"You haven't asked me any questions yet," Harry responded, lifting one shoulder in a half shrug.

"Why are there eleven of my students in the infirmary?" Dumbledore demanded, a trace of frustration entering his voice.

"I already said, for attempting to curse, maim, and possibly kill me," Harry answered, remembering how he would have acted in the headmaster's office in this situation when he was fourteen or fifteen. He would have been nervous and stuttering, and trying to defend himself from the very start. His reactions clearly were not what Dumbledore was expecting.

"Mr. Flamel," Snape's voice spoke up from the wall, his voice smooth and calm with his eyes intent on Harry, "Would you please share the pertinent events, from your perspective, that lead to eleven of my students laid up in the infirmary."

Mcgonagall and Dumbledore both looked over at Snape who surprised them with the reasonableness in his tone. He had also cut short further frustration in the Headmaster, and outrage in the Deputy.

Harry also turned to look at Snape, failing to hide the look of surprise at Snape was acting as the voice of reason. When he responded, it was a second's too late to hide the trace of disbelief. "Yes, Professor. It began this afternoon, after class but before dinner."

"I was making my way back to the Slytherin common room, when I came upon a group of students. Three of them were members of my house, including our seventh year male prefect, Lucian Bole." He shifted slightly so he was addressing Snape as much as Dumbledore, "They were picking on a group of first year Gryffindors, though they were focused on tormenting one of them specifically."

Mcgonagall stiffened and her lips thinned into a tight line once more. Harry ignored it, he wasn't sure she was going to do anything about it anyway. He hadn't ever seen evidence of her willing to go to bat to defend her house back on his home world.

"They had already caused her bag to rip, were holding her wand, threatening to snap it and telling her she did not belong here, and called her a mudblood," Harry's voice was even as he retold the events, "I... did not appreciate that."

"I summoned her wand from Bole's hand, helped levitate the books and guided the first year students away from the situation." Harry explained.

"Which of my first years was it?" Mcgonagall inquired tightly.

"I only got the name of one of them, the girl they were focused on, a Natalie McDonald," Harry responded, he hadn't remembered the girl from his world but that wouldn't have been surprising if she hadn't crossed his radar for one reason or another.

Mcgonagall just nodded in response, her bearing stiff and not pleased.

"That still does not explain how eleven Slytherins ended up in the infirmary," Dumbledore stated, bringing the focus back.

"Well, my… fellow Slytherin's did not appreciate my actions," Harry explained with a deprecating smile. "They were upset with me, but because we were out in public, they did not do anything at the time."

Snape resisted the urge to snort at the extreme understatement the youth had just made. But he managed to keep a straight face.

"I returned to the common room this evening, shortly before curfew, to find the entire house assembled. I'll admit, I was slightly confused, as I did not recall anyone calling for a house meeting," Harry smiled, an expression once more completely without humor. "Apparently that sort of thing happens when one violates the primary unwritten rule of Slytherin."

"Which is what?" Mcgonagall asked, focusing on him.

"Present a united front at all times. Never show division to the other houses. Agree in public, disagree in private. However you chose to phrase it," Harry answered, not missing the significant glance Dumbledore and Snape shared. Clearly the Deputy Headmistress was the only one who didn't seem to be aware of that.

"I do not enjoy letting others do my thinking for me," said Harry politely with a calm faint smile. "They had cleared out the center of the room as a dueling pit. Something that seemed surprisingly practiced and organized. They wanted to teach me a lesson, and teach it to the entire house at the same time."

"Ten house members, all seventh and six years decided they were going to teach that lesson," that smile on Harry's face grew slightly. "They arrayed themselves in a semicircle, wands drawn, and demanded that I apologize. Mr. Bole said that if I submitted myself and accepted my punishment, they would go far easier on me."

Harry paused, which caused Dumbledore to lean forward intently. "And what happened?"

"Well, they discovered that they had… grossly miscalculated in where they stood in terms of both skill and power," Harry's expression was practically predatory.

"You said there were ten, and yet eleven students were in the hospital," Mcgonagall said leadingly.

"Yes, well Draco Malfoy determined that he wasn't going to allow me to face it alone," Harry's voice shifted to a mixture of frustration and exasperation. "The cutting curse he took in the side was because I took my attention off of him, and he got distracted. But it also told me just how serious the Slytherin's were and how dangerous the situation was."

"So I decided to teach a lesson of my own." this time Harry's expression was almost beatific as he focused on Dumbledore. Of course he missed the way Snape's eyes narrowed as the potions professor stared at him.

"And what lesson is that Mister Flamel?" Dumbledore asked gravely.

"You want to play with the big boys then don't expect to be treated with kid gloves," Harry said shortly.

"You could have just stunned them," Dumbledore half asked, half stated.

"I certainly could have," Harry agreed amiably.

"Then why didn't you?" Dumbledore asked.

"Why would I?" Harry asked, affecting genuine puzzlement.

"So you could bring it to a professor and let us deal with it." The headmaster replied, his eyes narrowing.

"Why? So you could scold them and show them just how disappointed you were? So you could smack them on the wrist? Assign them detention where after two hours they are free with no lesson learned?" Harry challenged. "Sorry, things like that don't happen in the real world."

"So you appointed yourself judge and jury?" Dumbledore asked, his voice flat and grim.

"I responded to being attacked," Harry countered, his voice heating up. This was always his frustration with his own Dumbledore, and clearly the two men shared some of the same foibles. "Your way has no teeth, and has resulted a whole house feeling like they have to act like prats because a dozen or so of their members have the rest living in fear."

"People sleep in the same rooms for fear of being attacked and harassed or worse, taking shifts at night so they can make sure the other people in the room aren't harassed. Well, at least that happened until apparently, someone took steps this year," he smiled faintly but admitted to nothing. "However it doesn't stop the casual bullying that happens all the time within the house."

"However, this time they attempted to bully the wrong person," Harry smirked, despite himself. "And it backfired quite badly."

"You felt it was necessary to put them in the infirmary?" Snape asked, his eyes focused on Harry's expression. Dumbledore had interlaced his fingers in front of him and was watching, easily letting Snape take over the interrogation, while Mcgonagall just watched with still pursed lips.

"That's what one of their spells did to Malfoy first. And as irritating as he can be, Draco is..." Harry swallowed, unable to believe he was actually saying the next words, so they came out somewhat strained, "my friend. And was hurt because of trying to help me."

Snape regarded the boy in front of him closely for several long seconds, before he shook his head slightly, and leaned back against the wall, turning his focus back to Dumbledore.

"While I understand circumstances may have been beyond your control," Dumbledore spoke slowly, if he had caught off guard by Snape's sudden acquiescence, he didn't let on, picking up the attention of the room with only the slightest hesitation.

"Whatever your reasonings are, we do not allow fighting in Hogwarts. Thus I am assigning you a month of detentions wi-" the headmaster's statement was cut off when the stairs to the entrance of the headmaster's office moved drawing everyone's attention.

In stormed Perenelle Flamel, ignoring the presence of everyone else in the room, clearly on a mission as she target locked on Harry, storming forward. "Why exactly do you think you're doing?" The woman demanded as she got out her wand, though made no move to cast anything at him yet.

"Um. Talking to the professors and the headmaster?" Harry ventured, trying not to show it but obviously caught off guard with her behavior.

"And why didn't you come to the infirmary so I could check you out?" Perenelle demanded.

"Because… I wasn't hurt?" Harry responded his voice filled with confusion, And because I've been avoiding you since our last talk. He added mentally. He had been surprised the woman hadn't outed him after his confession on splitting his soul but certainly wasn't going to press his luck with her.

"Well, will you let me be the judge of that?" Perenelle questioned in a not-quite-demand while brandishing her wand, though not quite pointing it at him.

Harry opened his mouth to refuse before realizing where he was and equally as importantly who was here with them. So he relented by nodding his head slightly. She immediately began to check him over for spells, completely ignoring that they were in the headmaster's office.

"Well, you do seem to be okay this time." It was several minutes later when she lowered her wand looking satisfied, "Now, you're going to walk me back to the infirmary and tell me exactly what happened."

"Ahem," Dumbledore interrupted drawing the attention of all in the room back to him, "I apologize Madame Flamel; I need to finish my discussion with young Ares."

"Oh. All right then." Perenelle said agreeably, stepping back and crossing her arms.

Dumbledore looked at her for a moment before realizing that she had absolutely no intention of leaving. She met his gaze evenly, and just raised an eyebrow, waiting patiently.

Dumbledore turned his attention back to Harry with a stern look once more, "As I was saying, I am assigning you a month of detentions to be served with each of the head-"

"No." Perenelle cut in calmly.

Harry glanced over at her, looking more than a bit surprised. Her gaze was focused on Dumbledore so Harry as unfamiliar as it was to have someone else standing up for him, he knew she was far more accustomed to dealing with Dumbledore than he was. Or at least she had far more experience.

"Madame Flamel, young Ares put ten other students in the infirmary. Students you tended to. You should understand that a month of detentions is more than lenient." Dumbledore stated in a reasonable tone, before his voice hardened, "Especially when the alternative could be expulsion."

"All right," Perenelle nodded agreeably, with a pleasant smile on her face.

Harry looked over at her and scowled, that was a feeling he was much more used to. His elders never spoke up for him, unless it was to screw him. Her next words caused his brain to temporarily stop.

"Get the papers for expulsion please," Perenelle said evenly.

Harry blinked.

His reaction was much more muted than the professors. McGonagall's jaw dropped and she put a hand to her chest in astonishment. Snape's renowned control wasn't enough to stop his eyes from widening in disbelief.

"I beg your pardon?" Dumbledore asked, his hands dropping to the desk as he stared at Perenelle in astonishment.

"Is your hearing going Albus?" Perenelle asked curiously, affecting a concerned expression. "You should come to the infirmary to have that checked. I said to get the expulsion papers so you can fill them out in order to properly expel him."

"Perenelle, I'm afraid this is not a joke," Albus said seriously as her stared at her.

"I'm well aware of that Albus," Perenelle met his gaze without flinching, "After you give me the papers, I think it'll take about five minutes for Madame Maxime to accept him as a student of Beauxbatons. And that's only if it takes that long to find her."

"Perene-" Albus started to say, only to be cut off again.

"And I'm certain that your Daily Prophet will be more than happy to do an interview on Beauxbatons' newest student, and of course the circumstances behind why alternative education was necessary." Perenelle continued.

"It is beneath you to threaten, Perenelle," Dumbledore responded coldly.

"I'll remind you Albus, that you began with the threats first," Perenelle countered in a tone equally as cold.

"I did no such thing," Albus argued, irritation clearly on his face.

"Accept the detentions or face expulsion, sounds a lot like a threat to me," Perenelle responded with narrowed eyes, "Especially when the only thing I can determine he is guilty of is once more defending himself against an attack on his life in your castle."

"I hardly think his life was actually in danger," Dumbledore responded defensively. "No matter how foolishly the students were acting."

"Well, once again you'd be wrong. Go down and check Mister Malfoy. If that cutting curse had been any farther to his right, he might have lost his arm. To say nothing if it had been a bit higher and hit his neck." Perenelle answered.

"And the others that ended up in the infirmary?" Dumbledore challenged, "The ones he is responsible for putting there?"

"Which is once again, self-defense. I realize it's a concept in law books you tend to ignore," Perenelle countered, unwilling to let him gain traction there. "They did come in with an assortment of broken bones. Nothing life threatening if left untreated."

"Why could they not respond to us then? They couldn't see or hear anything we said." Albus questioned.

"Sensory deprivation spell," Harry spoke in an absent sort of way, his eyes focused on the various trinkets that lined Dumbledore's shelves. "After I had them down I applied it to all of them."

"If you had them down why did you do it?" Dumbledore demanded with a scowl.

"I doubted any of them would be able to shake it off or knew the right counter spell, and the sensory deprivation spell is one taught to most healers. The same couldn't be said of a stunning spell." Harry shrugged. "I wasn't willing to let a friend ennervate them and take a spell in the back."

Dumbledore stroked his beard before meeting Perenelle's eyes. When he realized there was going to be no give he focused on Harry once more. "Very well, but young man I cannot impress upon you enough to think about your actions and the consequences they have."

Harry just nodded, but Perenelle wasn't going to let the Headmaster get that much in. "Perhaps if that lesson had been imparted to others earlier. We wouldn't have had this issue in the first place." Perenelle put her hand on Harry's shoulder gently guiding him towards the door, before Dumbledore spoke up one more time.

"I trust we will not have a repeat of this incident. I will not be so lenient next time no matter what an old friend may threaten." Albus said coldly.

"We won't have this issue again," Perenelle agreed, squeezing Harry's shoulder to keep him from replying. "Next time he is attacked, in your castle, Ares will be under instructions to remove limbs rather than breaking them. He is our heir, after all."

There was silence as she followed Harry out the door before her voice drifted back up and into the office, "That is if he's kind enough to let the attackers survive at all."</pre>

<pre>"Are you really the new Lord Slytherin?" Daphne Greengrass asked.

"Apparently." Harry shrugged unconcerned.

Tracey Davis was white as a ghost like most of her classmates. "But… that means…you…"

"Means what?" Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.

"You're related to You-Know-Who!" Pansy Parkinson hissed.

"Who?"

"You know! You-Know-Who!"

"I don't know who. Last I checked I was related to the Potters… hence my name." Harry said as he put another spoon of porridge in his mouth.

"She's talking about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named." Daphne explained.

"If he can't be named then how am I supposed to know who she's talking about?" Harry frowned. He was really enjoying himself.

"V-V-V-V-"

"Vonder Voman?"

"Who? No! V-V-V-V-"

"Valentino?"

"She means Voldemort!" Came the highly irritated voice of Professor Snape.

The Great Hall was filled with screams and gasps with some people actually diving under the tables and running out the doors.

"Thank you Severus, for that." McGonagall said dryly she said as she stood to go and corral the frightened children.</pre>

<pre>Voldemort considered the letter he had received as well as how to get around the requirements. The sad fact was that he needed resources, and as a result he needed the Malfoys. "Our young Dragon has explained the limitations placed by the blood traitor Black. As a result, you will do the following: You will swear an oath to me that you will not use Draco Malfoy against me or allow him to work against me. You will then bind young Malfoy to you by oath. I would not have the resources he mentioned fall to those that are against me. You will then direct him as I order. Do you understand?"

"Yes, My Lord."

"Before you get any idea of betraying me, Crucio!" Severus Snape felt the curse for a moment before it was released.

A short time later he was making his way back to Hogwarts. He would not violate his oath. He would not knowingly allow Draco to work against Voldemort, nor direct Draco against him. He would bind Draco to him by Oath. He worked on the wording of the Oath as a logic puzzle as he traveled. I, Draco Malfoy, give Magical Oath that I will not inform Severus Snape of any actions I take against the Dark Lord Voldemort, nor allow others to be aware of any actions. Penalty for the breaking of this Oath shall result in the loss of Magical currency in the amount of 1 Knut to Severus Snape, deposited in a Jar without his knowledge.

Perhaps Narcissa would consent to witness the Oath. Yes, his Oath to Voldemort was VERY limiting, he smirked to himself. He would have to carefully not know anything.</pre>

<pre>Elsewhere, Crookshanks and his mate were furiously trying to calm the frightened mews of their kittens at the sudden arrival of a large red lion.

'Hush little ones! Or the Filch will find you,' Crookshanks scolded.

'But she'll eat us first!' the smallest, an orange and white striped kitten Crookshanks had referred to as Ohron, squealed.

'You don't recognize me?' Ginny asked, finally breaking her silence.

All five kittens, suddenly silent, shut their eyes to answer in the negative.

'I am the light that points the way, the rough tongue to bathe your fears and the claws to defend you. I am the whiskers and the teeth.'

'Bast?' Ohron finally mewed.

'It is! I recognize her from Mum's stories,' another began.

'She's here to save us!' all five cried.

Harry stood in awe of his human. Where had she learned to say that? He shook himself roughly. This was no time to get spiritual. They trusted her now, and that was all that mattered.

'Do you think you kittens can hang on?' Harry asked.

'You mean… we'd ride her?' Ohron's other brother, Honestlyronald , asked with awe.

'You'd have to hang on,' Ginny affirmed and each kitten mewed with increasing fervour their desire to do so.

The kittens' parents loaded them each on and Ginny winced as they dug their claws in to grab hold.

'You alright, Sparkplug?' Harry asked with concern.

'I'll be fine. I can't believe Filch wanted to drown them,' she growled.

'She's growling!' Ohron squealed.

'She's going to eat the Filch, I know it!' McGonyowl (the smoke grey one) giggled.

Ginny clearly was enjoying not only the feel of the kittens (minus the claws) but of the whole idea that she was a noble warrior goddess. Harry laughed as her stride became more or less a swagger. Her large body rippling with taut muscles and wiry sinew… Harry crushed those thoughts right there.

The kittens, too were having a good time, meowing and purring with abandon. Even Mog and Norris had seemed to have calmed down a little, though Harry could sense the tenseness that remained in them both.

As they rounded a corner the entire party stopped. There in front of them stood the Headmaster speaking with none other than the caretaker, Argus Filch.

"I can't find her anywhere, Headmaster. I know she's run off. She had a whole litter of kittens. What am I supposed to do with them?" Filch demanded, angrily.

Harry glared at the man and he could hear the total silence coming from Ohron and his siblings. Even their breathing was barely audible.

'Act natural, and keep moving, Sparkplug,' Harry advised.

'Dumbledore is going to see us!' Ginny warned.

'He doesn't know it's you, does he? Not like the man is mad enough to challenge a lioness with kittens. Mog, stay away from Filch and Norris stay underneath Ginny in case someone tries to grab you. Now… walk.' Of course it is well known that when moving Kneazles do not walk, neither do lions. They saunter, haughtily. This isn't a conscious choice, merely a fact of nature. So, it was with wide eyes that Argus filch saw the makeshift Pride saunter past him in regal form.

"Ah, there she is, Argus. She seems perfectly content," Dumbledore smiled.

"Headmaster… There's a lion in the castle!"

"Indeed there is, but as she seems to be a very friendly one, I don't think that it will be an issue. Of course I doubt others would view it this way so perhaps this is something best kept between ourselves."

Filch could only sputter incoherently and nod vaguely at the Headmaster's request.

The caretaker's eyes seemed to bug out of his skull when McGonagall walked past and gave the entire feline company a polite nod as she came walked past. Harry's keen ears picked up the conversation, even as they moved steadily toward the kitchens.

"Ah, Minerva, what can I do for you this evening?" Dumbledore asked.

"It's about Professor Umbridge," McGonagall began before she was interrupted.

"Professor, didn't you see that?" Filch demanded.

"See what?"

"The herd of… wild animals traipsing through the corridor!"

"They were hardly traipsing, Argus, they seemed more on a leisurely family stroll. The night is plenty nice enough for it. Now, Headmaster…"

"Shouldn't we do something about it?" Filch squawked again.

"I shouldn't think so. I believe the kittens are residents of the castle and the others will show themselves out in due time. You look positively frightful, Argus. Are you coming down with something? Perhaps you better see Poppy for that," McGonagall suggested.

Harry smiled as the thread of conversation finally became too thin to follow. He always did like Cousin McGonagall.

"No, this is not the way it is done! Next they will be asking to ride us for practice," Bane exploded.

"That's just stupid," Harry scoffed. "Who would want to ride you? You can't fly. Thestrals are much better mounts."</pre>

<pre>"Now don't go causing too much trouble, I don't want a letter from your Head of House on the first day," Andromeda lectured. Harry discreetly rolled his eyes. The entire drive to King's Cross Station she'd been lecturing him about proper behaviour and decorum for a boy on the threshold of manhood, as she'd described it.

"Love, you've mentioned that twice before. I think Harry gets the picture. Now keep on like that and he won't want to come back," Ted sighed.

"Ted, as his guardians it's our duty to give him guidance and proper instruction…"

"On proper shagging technique?" Harry interrupted.

"Harry Potter!" Andromeda scolded. "That's hardly…"

"I walked in on you going at it on the sofa, the stairs, bathroom sink, three times on the kitchen table and on Dora's bed."

"You did what!" Tonks screeched from the seat next to him. She'd been silently providing moral support to her newly adopted brother from their Mum's rants until that moment. "Parents, do not tell me that you actually did… that on MY bed!"

"Fine, we won't tell you we did that, but to be fair you have moved out so it's really more of a guest bed now and we were going to wash the sheets before you got back," Andromeda politely informed her daughter.

"What do you mean were going to?" Dora demanded.

Ted shrugged. "Harry interrupted us, your mum chased him off and truthfully I forgot all about it until now."

"Your mum is scary even when she's naked," Harry whispered.

"When was that?" Dora asked weakly.

"A week ago, I think."

"I slept in that last night!"

Ted grinned wickedly. "Think of that as payback for that Gryffindor you brought home your seventh year."

"What's he mean?" Harry asked, now very confused.

"Nothing, absolutely nothing," Dora muttered, her hair having gone a bright orange.</pre>

<pre>The loud thumping of feet and shouting of voices that were thundering up the corridor drew both champion's attention away from their slightly melancholy conversation. The pattering of paws, barely audible over the din, caused Harry to look down and see Merlin leading a pack of very angry Slytherin boys on a fair chase.

"What did you do?" Harry called out.

'I shat in their shoes, I shat in all their shoes, Harry!'

"How did you manage that? That's a bloody great lot of shoes!"

'Voles before moles, Harry. You know that. Now, can't stop, have to get to the birdie-claw tower!'

Merlin, true to his word scampered past and six Slytherin boys, Malfoy included, thundered past a moment later.</pre>

<pre>"C'mon," Ron muttered. When they did find Hermione, it was with a certain amount of surprise as she was deep in conversation with none other than Luna Lovegood.

"Newt Scamander's text is quite comprehensive, Luna, and I haven't found mention of a Crumple-horned Snorkack anywhere. I'm sorry to say they simply aren't real."

"Oh, but they are, daddy has seen one. We just haven't been able to capture one yet."

"Have you seen one?" Hermione challenged.

"No," Luna replied innocently, "but then I haven't seen a tornado, either, and I do believe those exist."

"Well of course those exist," Hermione huffed. "They're well documented weather phenomenon."

"Documented by whom?" Luna asked innocently.

"Scientists of course!"

"Are these the same funny men who deny magic is real, because they haven't seen it?"

Ron chose that moment to save a sputtering Hermione from a bout of self-righteous indignation. "Hullo," Ron stammered.</pre>

<pre>Arabella stared without blinking at the newly installed television in the bakery in town. She'd merely gone to pick up a loaf of bread for dinner, but had ended up with her eyes glued to the wretched box as she watched the most dramatic news story unfold in real time.

It seemed that a group of young hooligans had managed to commandeer a tan Volvo; one that looked suspiciously like the car that Arabella had leant to Molly for the day to pick up the children from the station. She couldn't be quite sure, until the camera from the helicopter zoomed in on a medium-sized boy with messy black hair, who had climbed out onto the roof of the vehicle and was now making terribly rude gestures at the pursuing police vehicles. The glimpses of red hair from inside the car confirmed it. Molly was going to have kittens, Arabella thought. A moment later, the boy she was sure was Harry, threw something and the entire roadway was near instantly engulfed in a thick grey smoke.

When the smoke cleared a minute later, the car was nowhere to be seen. Arabella sighed, finally paid for her bread and began the walk home, trying to think how she was going to tell Sebastian that his favourite not-nephew had committed another arrestable offence. She shuddered involuntarily. When would the boy learn a sense of the law? She prayed once again that she wouldn't see her ward end up in Azkaban.

As it turned out, Arabella didn't have to say anything as it seemed Molly had arrived at the house with Percy, and had informed her uncle of at least the fact that the boy had stolen the car. As Molly was just finishing up, the squealing of tires could be heard as the wanted Volvo skidded to a stop.

"That was so wicked! I can't believe Arabella didn't tell me there was an invisibility booster installed," Harry yelled. Arabella's eyebrows shot up in silent accusation at her brother. She certainly hadn't put an invisibility booster on the car. "Ron, we're home. Ron, wake up!" Harry continued yelling. The occupants of the house were still as they watched and listened to the chaos that was just deposited outside the door.

Harry wrenched open the rear door of the car and Ron tumbled gracelessly to the pavement. "OW! Whadja-do-that-fer" Ron mumbled incoherently, trying his best to wake up.

"Ron, you can't possibly tell me that you managed to sleep through that entire thing, can you?" Fred asked, his voice dripping with disbelief.

"Why not? It was just Harry driving a car. Not like we were being hunted by dark wizards, fighting massive snakes, or trying to outrun Muggle Please-men."

"Ron… we were outrunning Please-men," George informed him. "There were sirens, and Harry was driving like a drunken sailor."

"At least until he climbed out the window and let Ginny drive," Fred amended.

"Oh no, mates, I must have really just been knackered," Ron shrugged. "Why were we running from the Please-men, anyway?"

"That is a very good question, Ron. It is certainly something I'm going to have to speak with Harry about," Sebastian called out. "Now, you lot get home. I have some things to discuss with the little car thief, here." Even Harry recognised the sure-fire signs of an impending parental lecture, and so he shuffled into the house slightly less euphoric than he had arrived.</pre>

<pre>"You want us to do what, Harry?" Hermione whispered rather dramatically.

"I need you and Ron to be the diversion. There are going to be two of them and I'll need someone to distract them for enough time for me to get in close."

"How do you propose we do that? Walk in with signs that read 'Ickle firsties ready for the cursing?'" Ron drawled out.

"If that's what it takes, but I would suggest a good old-fashioned snog."

Both Ron and Hermione turned beet red. "How in the name of Merlin's arse cheeks is that supposed to help?" Ron bellowed.

"Really, Ron, do you want the whole forest to hear us?" Harry replied calmly. "And to answer your question, I don't mean a little peck on the lips, but a full blown 'about to shag your brains out' snog. You and Hermione would burst in the clearing, your hands roaming all over each other. This little bit is important because not only will the movement distract the eye of the opponent, it will also allow you to get your wands out without being so obvious about it. Remember, I've arrived a moment or two before, just enough to assure these dog-rotters that I'm alone. Then you two pop in, checking the other thoroughly for any swelling in one another's throat and making comments about how you don't think the teachers will find you here. As soon as they turn to you, Neville will shoot a spell from behind them, from underneath the Invisibility Cloak. Then, I charge in, gut them both, save Ginny and bippty boppity boop we're back to the castle. No one's the wiser and everyone's a little more relaxed." Harry finished his soliloquy with a grand flourish of his hand and a massive grin.

"And you think this will work, do you?" Ron asked sceptically.

"Do you have a better plan?"

"Well, it's just why can't I be the one under the cloak?"

"Fine by me," Neville chimed in. "I'll snog Hermione and you can hide. I prefer more action anyway."

Ron glared at both of the other boys for a moment before slapping Neville on the side of the head.

"Oi! What was that for?" Neville demanded.

"You're under the cloak, I'll snog Hermione and save my sister, too!"

"Wait a minute!" Hermione screeched.

"A girl's first kiss is supposed to be special! Don't I get a say in any of this?"

"Do you want to save Ginny?" Harry calmly asked.

"Of course."

"Then you have to understand, this is the only way. Everyone has to make sacrifices for the good of the Pride. I'm sorry, Hermione, but this includes you too."

"But… I'm not like that!"

"Don't worry, Hermione, I'm sure Ron won't think any less of you for being a bad kisser," Neville commented.

"I'm not a bad kisser!"

"Then prove it," Ron smirked.

"Harry, is this the only way to save Ginny? I'm sure I could come up with one, if I had a little time. I mean even just a couple minor changes…"

"Hermione, we don't have the time. Please, I need your help with this and this is the only way I can be sure it will work. I swear we won't tell a soul how you helped. Please?" Harry put on his best 'lost and scared kitten' expression and for a moment Hermione seemed indecisive before finally blowing out a loud breath.

"Fine, but this does not mean I fancy you, Ron!"

"Of course not, no one is going to be interested in me snogging the biggest know-it-all in the castle anyway. They'd only ask if you tasted like book paste."

"I do not taste like book paste!"

"Couldn't say for sure, could I? Never tried it on with you," Ron shot back. Hermione glared fiercely at her ginger friend before launching herself at his mouth.

Harry and Neville stood stock still with identical expressions of shock on their faces. "Doesn't look like either knows what they're doing, does it?" Neville whispered.

"No, but they'll do," Harry whispered back. "Harum," Harry cleared his throat. This had the unique effect of causing the angrily kissing duo to break apart suddenly, both with rapidly rising shades of red.

"Can we get on with this then?" Harry asked.

Ron nodded mutely, while Hermione stood. Grabbing the lanky boy's hand she drug him to his feet and strode resolutely into the forest, leaving Neville and Harry behind.

"Do you think they really fancy each other?" Neville asked.

"Nah," Harry replied. "He's never even tried to give her a mouse."</pre>

<pre>"Captains, shake hands. I want a nice, clean game," Madam Hooch said as the two captains shook hands uneasily. There wasn't the fierce rivalry between Ravenclaw and Gryffindor that Slytherin enjoyed with the home of the brave, but it was Quidditch after all, and no one should take that lightly.

Madam hooch blew her whistle and all the players kicked off into the air, except Harry, who stood stock still for just a moment, emitting a whistle that would have summoned a London taxi cab from halfway across the city. An instant later, and one noble and gallant Hippogriff was making an emergency landing on the Quidditch pitch, causing cries of alarm from all those present. More so when Harry mounted his noble steed and they launched powerfully into the air.

"Harry! What in the name of Merlin do you think you're doing?" Wood cried.

Harry merely smirked. "Told you my ride was outside." But as Harry and noble steed lighted into the air, the shrill whistle of Madam Hooch sounded.

"Potter, Wood, on me!" she shouted. Harry nudged Gordon with his knee and the noble Hippogriff wheeled around in a second and began attempting to hover in place. Not an easy thing to do, he informed Harry.

"It'll be over in a minute," Harry reassured his friend.

"Potter, what's the meaning of this?" Madam Hooch demanded. "We play Quidditch on brooms, here at Hogwarts. Wood, I'm going to have to disqualify your Seeker if you don't have a very good explanation for this."

"Madam Hooch, I checked the rules," Harry began. "And international Quidditch rules, which is what we conform to here at Hogwarts, state that no mount may be used that has been magically modified outside what the original maker intended. I can assure you that Gordon is anything but modified, despite how magnificent he may seem. He conforms to all Quidditch rules and as a matter of fact, the Chudley Cannons' beaters in 1563 flew on Thestrals, setting a precedent for magical creatures being used in the game. While I grant it isn't common…" Harry trailed off, grateful that he'd memorized the speech Ron had given him the night before.

"Wood, did you know about this?" Madam Hooch demanded.

"No, Madam Hooch. I didn't," Wood responded, shooting Harry a glare that clearly read win or no, they would be having words after the game.

"Very well… as I don't think this was a deliberate attempt of deceit on behalf of the captain and it does seem that the rules allow it, I suppose I'm going to have to allow it, at least this once."

"Keahhhh!" Gordon cried, shocking both Wood and Madam Hooch so badly they nearly fell off their brooms.

"Let's go, Mate!" Harry yelled in response and in another moment, they were off again, boy and Hippogriff circling the pitch to a now curiously silent crowd. The mesmirization only lasted a few moments though, broken by the Slytherin jeers.

'They are most disrespectful, Sir Harry. Perhaps my brethren should teach them proper tournament etiquette?'

"Don't worry about it, Sir Gordon, I think they're mostly Americans."

'Oh, well that would explain it, then.' With that, Harry and Gordon circled silently.

"Incoming!" Harry yelled suddenly and the Hippogriff folded his wings and dropped like a stone, narrowly avoiding a Bludger.

'Bloody Hell! You didn't tell me this was a combat tournament. That changes things all together!' The Hippogriff's voice was bordering on ecstatic.

"It isn't exactly, but, I suppose as long as we don't make contact…"

'We'll make sure they need new undergarments!'

"Right, you fly, I'll look for the Snitch. When I tell you to leave off though, you have to do exactly what I say."

'Fair enough, now let's get ready to joust!'

"And Gryffindor has seized the Quaffle, Bell passes to Spinnet and back to Bell, now over to Johnston she shoots, she scores! Gryffindor leads 190 to 30! Ravenclaw back in possession of the Quaffle, moving in a classic Aldemeijer formation and there comes Harry the Hippogriff herder! Handling his mount with natural grace, that certainly disrupted their formation… AND Spinnet seizes the Quaffle again," boomed the magically amplified voice of Lee Jordan. Harry was having a terrible time finding the Snitch, but he and Gordon were more than making up for it by consistently disrupting Chaser formations and giving no end of grief to the Ravenclaw Beaters. Gordon, in particular, seemed to find the idea of participating in a combative tournament great fun.

Gryffindor had just scored another goal, when Harry saw the fluttering of gold wings. "Down and to the right, mate. I have to catch the little gold thing. Just go as hard and fast as you can and feel for my directions."

'Aye, Sir Harry!' And with that, Hippogriff and human went into a spectacular dive. A blur of motion to the left drew Harry's attention. The Ravenclaw Seeker had obviously spotted it too, and she was racing towards the golden ball with a burning ferocity.

"She won't beat us," Harry growled. It had taken him half a second to realize that the opposing Seeker was none other than the very same Miss Chang that Harry had proclaimed his undying yearning for earlier in the year and in retaliation she and many of her friends had adopted the sport of Harry hunting. Harry failed to find the amusement and as such made it a point of personal pride to beat her.

Cutting in on a diagonal course, Cho managed to snake in front of her rival for a few seconds, but a few seconds was all it took.

Harry was mesmerized. Arse… beautiful, round, perfect-for-bearing-kittens arse, was all that flashed through his dazed mind as he and Gordon trailed their opponent, all thoughts of revenge flying right out of his head. If he shifted his weight a little and sat up just enough, he could get a better view…

'Harry! What are you doing? The small flying egg is changing direction. You must catch it, mustn't you?'

"Follow that arse!" Harry yelled, and without thinking sat up even straighter. A second later and the Bludger would have sailed harmlessly over the messy head of hair, but it didn't. Though mercifully, Harry was pretty sure he was unconscious the moment it struck him so he was thus saved the headache of the moment and the uncomfortable, though relatively short, fall to the ground.

"Potter is out, and Chang catches the Snitch. The match goes to Gryffindor, Two hundred ten to one hundred eighty!" Lee Jordan called out, his voice in a state of confusion due to the conflicting feelings of winning the match but losing the Snitch. It just didn't happen very often.</pre>

<pre>'My young knight of the lower realm, how do you do?' Came the loud squawk of Sir Gordon from the pen of Hippogriffs.

'Not doing badly. What has Hagrid decided for you?' Harry mewed.

'Nothing yet, Sir Harry. We haven't been allowed in the air for some time. The Ferret Man thinks we might be allowed in another week or two, but he also said we might be sent back.'

'Sent back where?' Harry asked quickly.

'Oh, you know… back to where we came from, with the others. Now, how are you after the most awful fall you suffered, from a broomstick no less!' Sir Robin asked, quickly changing the subject.

'Oh, I'm doing fine. I have been working on some magic to make sure that doesn't happen again. Thank you for your concern though.'

'No trouble at all. It is right that we look after a young man of so noble a standing as you. However, I do hope that you've learned your lesson about flying on such dangerous contraptions as a broomstick. In the future I would advise you only to take to the skies with a noble and judicious guide such as us.'

Harry laughed softly. The Hippogriffs were always so amusing. 'I suppose. My captain has been on me to get a new broom ever since I lost the last one, so I suppose I will have to make do with that.'

The shocked looks on all four of the Hippogriffs' faces startled Harry. Their previous joking seemed no longer quite so innocent as the four gathered their heads together with quietly whispered words.

'Sir Harry, we must object most strongly to this plan of yours,' Sir Gawain began.

'Indeed, it would not do for a Knight of the Lower Realm to again be subjected to such a life threatening injury as you have faced prior. We must demand that one of us accompany you to your next tournament, where we will lead you to victory!' Gordon finished.

'I suppose so?' Harry said slowly. 'I must make sure that this would be legal in the rules of my… tournament.'

'Of course you must. One must obey the proper forms of a tournament. We will abide by that. Now brothers, let us send off our young Knight with a resounding huzzah!'</pre>

<pre>"Ron," Harry moaned wishing for at least the third time that very minute that his friend would please be less enthusiastic while Harry's head attempted to sue his body for divorce. "I didn't know what I was doing. I remember the mermaid bit and some things about dancing wombats and a dragon named Pinkerton who wanted me to swim in his lake of syrup, but beyond that I'm drawing a blank. Perhaps you'd care to explain it?"

Ron's eyes gleamed, "Alright, but it'll have to be fast. I'm supposed to tell McGonagall when you're awake."

"Where's Madam Pomfrey?"

"At St. Mungo's," Ron replied.

"Why is she there?"

"Because you tried to drop a chandelier on her,"

"WHAT? How badly is she hurt? Am I going to get expelled?" Harry began to hyperventilate, until Ron put his hand on Harry's shoulder and squeezed.

"Harry, no one important got hurt. You tried to drop a chandelier on her, tried being the operative word. I heard Professor Flitwick say that she decided to go to St. Mungoe's until you came down and that McGonagall should send for her as soon as you were under control. Now, are you going to let me tell the story, or should I get Prof the Cat now?" At seeing Harry's confused look for their Head of House, Ron clarified, "What you called her in the dungeon. Anyway, you seem to remember sniffing that bag of herbs Professor Sprout had in Herbology and a second after you went crazy. Tried to hug the devil's snare and then threw it across the room, nearly hit me, and then you ran out of the greenhouse through one of the windows yelling 'I am the king of ham, show me your boobies.'"

Ron took a moment to savour his friend's wide eyed stare. "Then after that you made straight for the castle, and I don't mind telling you the havoc you caused for at least two hours in there. You jumped on Filch's back and grabbed his ears all the while yelling 'I'm a tasty troll trollop, away to the cat house.' You managed to poke every single Hufflepuff in the stomach on their way to lunch and declared yourself Duke and defender of pudding. Whereupon you growled at everyone approaching the headmaster's chair. Until…" Ron smiled evilly.

"Until what, Ron?" Harry snapped. The whole thing was beginning to sound farfetched, but Harry couldn't quite begin to make himself disbelieve. He hoped beyond hope that he managed to pass out after the purple wombats, but Harry felt that sinking sensation in his stomach that said Ron was likely telling the truth.

"Well, you saw this older girl, a Ravenclaw and ran straight for her, screaming 'Would you like to making fuck?' You chased her all the way to the Potions Classroom, I heard. I was impressed. I don't recall you every saying 'fuck' before."

"What was her name?" If he really did do all the things Ron said, Harry would need to studiously avoid any Hufflepuffs and certainly this thus far unnamed Ravenclaw.

"Yeah, I asked Ginny's friend about that. Figured she might know. Odd girl, she is. Don't really know what to make of her."

"Her name, Ron," Harry interrupted forcefully.

"Cho Chang, a fourth year with a cute bum. Pity too, Luna says she's vowed revenge or something like that. Said you scared her half to death after you started ripping your clothes off. Of course Fred and George appreciated the aftermath."

Harry closed his eyes and counted to five. He was beginning to think Ron enjoyed teasing him with nearly completed thoughts. Ron for his part sensed his friend's growing impatience and decided to finish his story quickly. "Well you made it all the way to Snape's room where Fred and George were just getting out of class. Cho made it there a few seconds before and started yelling about Harry Potter trying to kill her. Well, Snape pulled out his wand and walked out to the corridor to see what was going on and you jumped up and grabbed his nose and then punched him below the belt. Fred and George said it was the most beautiful sight when they saw him slump to the ground."

"Isis, Snape's going to get me expelled," Harry muttered.

"He was hopping mad, that's for sure, but I think it really clinched it when you put your foot on his chest and announced that the King of Ham took no prisoners and that 'they' better hand over 'their' wenches before you got violent. Well, at that point McGonagall had shown up and according to Fred your exact words were 'egads! Prof the Cat, my wenches must wait onwards to the virgin sacrifice' and then you ran up three flights of stairs went out the window and apparently demanded from the giant squid a virgin mermaid to sacrifice to your dark goddess Isis."

"Wow… I really did all of that?"

Ron nodded enthusiastically. "What really shocked everyone was that five minutes later the squid brought one up."

"Was she really topless?"

"Not at first, but I heard you yelling about Goddess Isis demanding breasts and seaweed."

"Wait… you heard me? Where were you?" Harry asked, quite perplexed at this point.

"In the tower. Dumbledore made everyone return to their common rooms to avoid any more afternoon disturbances. Why do you ask?"

"If you were in the tower, Ron, then how did you hear me?"

"Harry, I'd be surprised if the whole bloody castle didn't hear you. It was like you had a Sonorous charm cast on you. Anyway, after that you demanded that a house-elf turn your new find into shushee or sushi or something like that and when you couldn't find one I guess you chased one down in the castle. Anyway, I heard McGonagall and Flitwick talking about how it took another four or five hours to get you pinned down."

"And no one thought to, I dunno, Stun me or something?"

"Flitwick tried a bunch of non-lethal curses, apparently, but they said you were too slippery. Just kept bouncing around like a Kneazle on a frying pan." Harry growled at the witticism, but otherwise said nothing as his friend continued the narration. "Anyway, it seemed Professor Vector from Arithmancy might have hit you with a Stunner, but it didn't have any effect. They had to wait until you practically passed out and then they brought you in here and chained you up."

"Why'd they do that?" Harry finally asked.

"Because, Mr. Potter," came the Scottish accent of one Minerva McGonagall as she brusquely strode into the room. "Dumbledore wasn't at all sure that a Body Bind would be sufficient in keeping you subdued after you brought down half the castle. Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would be so kind as to return to the common room you may let your House know that your friend is awake and alive once more. In the meantime, Mr. Potter, you and I have some things to discuss with the headmaster."

With a wave of her wand the chains released her bound cousin and with a wave of her hand, Minerva McGonagall sent the youngest Weasley male running.

Sirius Black's day was not going at all how he had planned. After he'd met the helpful little orange ball of fluff and tried to explain the situation to him, Crookshanks seemed intent on helping him. Sirius needed to meet his Godson, that much was certain. Unfortunately, it seemed that the local wildlife had a mind of their own and for some reason Hagrid had begun keeping a lion on the grounds. He tried to fathom a reason for her presence, but even with Hagrid's unique taste in pets, Sirius wasn't at all sure how Dumbledore would allow it, especially with her being so hungry.</pre>

<pre>"Professor?"

"Yes, Mr. Potter."

"Since the term really hadn't started when we flew the car and Ginny wasn't part of Gryffindor…"

"No, Mr. Potter, no House Points will be taken. However you both will be receiving detentions."

Harry looked puzzled. "That's nice, but I was wondering if we have to sleep outside or miss breakfast or something you know… important."

Don't kill… he's not all human. That had been Minerva's chant the previous year once she was aware of Mr. Potter's 'furry little problem'. It looked like she'd need it again. "Mr. Potter despite what you think House Points are considered by many here to be 'important'. Now if you'll excuse me I have to rejoin the feast."

"That could have gone worse," Harry observed, as their head of house swept out of the room rather hurriedly.

"Mum's still going to kill me." Ginny said morosely.

"Maybe, but not until Christmas. That's a whole term away! So live a little. This Friday I'll take you to meet Hagrid. I think you'll like him." Ginny smiled a little.

"Anyone you like has to be a bit of alright Paws."

"There you are! Now come on. Dinner's wasting."</pre>

<pre>"Do you know what unicorn blood does Harry?" Dumbledore asked. Harry looked puzzled and shook his head side to side.

"It will save you if you are an inch from death but at a terrible cost. You will live a half life, a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips."

"Good, I hope that son-of-a-bitch rots in the festering dog kennels."

"I do not think it was for him alone, Harry. Can you think of anyone who might want to use that until he could gain true mortality again?"

"No, not really, maybe Professor Binns? He seems happy as a ghost though."

"Albus, you don't mean You-Know-Who?" McGonagall looked scared for the first time since Harry had ever seen her.

"Oh, you mean Voldemort?" Harry asked.

Dumbledore chuckled softly while his professor winced. "Very good Harry I'm glad you can say his name. Fear of a name increases fear of a thing itself."

"No, I just want to be clear. I never understood He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, because what if there is someone you really don't like and don't want to say their name? It makes things so troublesome."

Dumbledore chuckled again. In so many ways the boy had grown up far too quickly and others he was still the baby he'd dropped off at his Aunt's house ten years ago. "Yes, Voldemort. While Professor Snape had his suspicions that Quirrell may have been up to no good, it took your story tonight to confirm any suspicion that the late Professor Quirrell was in league with Voldemort and I believe his eventual attempt at far more nefarious activities within this castle."

"You mean stealing the Philosopher's Stone?" Harry asked.

"You know about the stone! I'm delighted. Yes Harry, stealing the Stone. Professor Snape though it was for his own selfish interests. It seems however that our good professor was possessed by our old friend Voldemort. I believe that his eventual plan was to revive himself enough to make an attempt on the stone and return to full power. We need not be worried about it in the future though."

"So he was the one that really wanted to kill the unicorns?"

"Yes, Harry, I believe he was."

"I'm going to get him then. Not today, but I will. He deserves to die... permanently."

"Harry, death and killing is not always the answer. That is what has gotten us into the place we are today. Defend those you love, yes, but don't seek out to kill independently. You have been given a fine gift, use it wisely."

"Professor, if what you told me is true and Voldemort is still alive and ready to return then it seems that not killing is what got us into the place we are today. If we let rabid dogs loose then they'll come back to bite us. That much I know."

Seeing the boy wouldn't be won over at the moment, Dumbledore and McGonagall both gently stood and with a flick of a wand vanished the conjured armchairs. "I think it is time for you to sleep. I spoke with Madam Pomfrey and she assures me you'll be out this time tomorrow."

+

Hey, our Seeker is back!" Katie Bell observed loudly. Ever since the incident with Norbert the rest of the team had only referred to him as 'Seeker' or 'the Seeker' if they had to mention him at all. Harry's head coolly swivelled to the source of the noise.

"Good, at least we should win the Quidditch match," a burly fifth year commented.

"Won't win the House Cup though, the ickle firsties took care of that," Angelina Johnson commented dully. Agreement was had all around and the initial excitement at their star player's return died down quickly. Breakfast was soon over and the great hall emptied quickly. Passing the hourglasses that recorded House points George was the first one to notice. "Hey! I think these things are defective... we're a hundred points up" Excited whispers broke out around the Gryffindors and speculative whispers passed around the other three. When someone finally asked the assembled lions, 'Hey who did that?' No one knew until a lone first year voice popped up.

"Neville, I heard, for protecting the greenhouses from another troll!" Harry's voice was quickly drowned out by the excited questions and congratulations from his housemates drowned out Neville's protestations that he didn't do anything really.

Walking away, Hermione eyed her friend with a speculative stare. "Harry, why did you lie?"

"What on earth do you mean, Hermione?" Harry said with a spring in his step.

"Neville didn't protect the green houses from a troll. He was revising an essay for Potions with us last night. And as no one else spoke up it only is logical that you're the one who gained a hundred points. Which begs the question... what did you do and why did you give the credit to Neville?"

"First, I can't tell you. Don't look at me like that… Dumbledore made me promise at least for now. Secondly he needed it more than I do."

"What do you mean, mate?" Ron asked quizzically.

"Ron, you didn't actually do anything so no one really blames you. Hermione, I'm sorry it couldn't be you but you're too visible and you have Ron and me. Neville's kind of alone and people still blame him for trying to help us."

"It was a terribly foolish thing to do, Harry," Hermione reminded him.

"And the bravest thing I've seen a Gryffindor do this year Hermione. He's going to do great things."

"Really? Neville? I have never thought of him as a great wizard really." Ron commented.

"Oh ye of little faith. You watch. He'll be there."</pre>

<pre>"Hagrid, the centaurs told us to look to the Kneazles. We should see what's been going on!" Hermione persisted.

"Yeh might have somethin' there. Never said you were the brightest witch in yer year fur nothing,'" the giant man chuckled.

Hermione blushed at the praise, and hurried at a near run to keep up with her protector. The closer they got the more apparent it was that the noise was generated by a large number of feline vocal cords mewling in near unison as if calling for someone or mourning the dead. When they got close enough the young witch could make out the forms of nearly thirty Kneazles surrounding what looked like three bodies. The first was what she suspected caused the commotion, an all-black one of their own lay prone on the ground, his black fur was marred by a thick coat of dark red blood around his mouth and on his paws. It was like a nature show on the telly! Behind him lay the slain form of a unicorn and the form of a man... She felt woozy and the forest started to swim. Black blisters like those of burn victims marked the man's face, neck and hands. A look of terror was etched into the man's face and a large portion of his throat seemed to be missing. Looking a little closer she realized it wasn't any man, she knew him... It was Professor Quirrell their Defence professor. She emptied the contents of her stomach onto her shoes, not caring for once what became of her robes.

Hagrid fought down the same feeling as he approached the scene. Whether he liked the man or not, it was only proper that he retrieve the body for Dumbledore. Looking down at the scene before him it was difficult to tell what had happened. Three bodies, and while it was clear enough that the Kneazle had killed... that was impossible. It looked like the Kneazle had killed the professor and judging from a few flecks left on his robes the professor may well have killed the unicorn before him. That shouldn't have been possible. No underweight house cat should have been able to kill a defense professor, inept as the man was.

Hagrid gently wrapped the dead man securely in his cloak and hoisted the body over his shoulder like a sack of beans and then bent down gently to lift the still-breathing Kneazle from the forest floor; Dumbledore would certainly want to take a look at him. Two separate sets of teeth sunk deeply into his hand and the mewling turned into a much more formidable growl. Being nearly ten feet tall and with a hide as thick as many giants', Hagrid wasn't physically intimidated by much. Even he had to admit this caught him a little off guard.

Hermione spoke softly, "Please, we don't want to hurt him. He needs help. We just want to help him." After a few more promises of attention and their good intentions the Pride reluctantly parted and let her through. She gently scooped up the large feline in her arms and began to carry him much the same way one would carry a tired toddler. His breathing was shallow, but regular. Hermione had no idea if Madam Pomfrey could cure magical animals, but she hoped so. She didn't like to see any animal killed without reason. It was a long road back as they trudged in silence to the castle.</pre>

<pre>In a way though Harry was glad that he could be human here. The idea of all these competing odors, smells and so much movement impacting his Kneazle brain would just be too much. After transforming back and forth the difference between the senses was palpable. It was nice to have them dimmed a bit with all these distractions. He did wish people would stop staring at him though. Everywhere they went if Hagrid happened to mention Harry's name people would stop and stare, or try to shake his hand. That lasted until Harry couldn't take the contact anymore. Really why did humans always insist on rushing right into things so blindly? Hadn't anyone ever watched a proper Kneazle greeting? They would circle and observe getting closer each time and then finally, gently touch noses to exchange scents. None of this sudden movement and hullabaloo.

"Hagrid, why do people keep staring at me?"

"Yeh mean apart from the fac' that yeh just punched Ludo Bagman in the nose?" Hagrid chuckled.

"He surprised me, shouldn't poke a sleeping Kneazle." Harry grumped.

"Eh... Don't ya mean never poke a sleepin' dragon?"

"No, dragons may breath fire and try to eat you, but they don't run up your led and dig claws into your bollocks." Harry smiled, taking fiendish delight at Hagrid's sudden fit of discomfort. "Really though, why is everyone staring at me?"

"Well because yer Harry Potter!" Hagrid exclaimed as though this solved everything.

"Don't follow you."

"You defeated you-know-who... A little baby defeated the greatest evil wizard know and then yeh disappeared for nine years Harry! Blimey, who wouldn't want to shake yer hand?"

"Ummm... Wait, I'm Harry Potter?" Harry's eyebrows creased. He'd read that story hundreds of times with Ginny growing up. He'd even been part of a wedding once when she was seven where she married Harry. While Harry did recognize that he had the same name as this mystical figure, he certainly couldn't see himself doing that.

"Who did yeh think yeh were Harry? Agusta Longbottom?"

"Well no, but I didn't think I was that Harry Potter. I figured I was just named for him." It seemed logical enough. After all Arabella had always called him Harry even before he transformed to a human.

"No 'arry, you are THE Harry Potter. Man and mystical legend and all that." Hagrid smiled happy to be able to tease the young boy.

"Wait, so I defeated a dark wizard. Who was he again?"

"You-know-who Harry."

"No, I don't. I've heard of you-know-who, but I've never actually figured out who that was. Seems awfully silly to call him that, especially if not everyone knows who he is."

+

Luckily for Hagrid Harry's curiosity was peaked throughout the day by all the different places they went and he forgot all about you-may-or-may-not-know-who. First was Gringotts bank, run by goblins and Harry hated it. Not because of any particular feelings of Kneazles towards goblins, but because Harry hated the feeling of being trapped below ground. Arabella had explained the concept of money to Harry before he left and he was very glad at this point that he paid attention during Ginny's arithmetic lessons. Next they had visited Flourish and Bott's book store and then on to Madam Malkin's for more ughhh... Clothes and finally onto lunch at Eyelops Owl Emporium. At least Harry assumed it would be lunch especially when Hagrid offered to buy him one as a birthday present, but the large man seemed slightly put off when Harry asked if he could just have part of the bird as he wasn't feeling terribly peckish right then but a good wing and some breast meat would do nicely. The clerk asked them to leave when Harry inquired if cooking was a requirement prior to purchase.

+

Apparently word of his flying escapades had gotten around and made many of the other Gryffindors rather cross with him. The second and third years didn't seem so badly off. Maybe the points dictated mating privileges and the teachers were preventing upper years from sex? That's something he hadn't thought to ask. He would have to next time he saw Professor McGonagall. Harry still couldn't decipher what house points did.

+

Despite Harry's placement as the starting Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team, Hermione didn't seem to give an inch. She insisted that he would have made it anyway without costing the house thirty points. Harry wasn't quite sure why she was so irritated. The second and third year's still weren't all that upset about it so Harry was positive it had something to do with sex. Maybe she wasn't getting any? Although he was sure that was very true, he was sure that wasn't the answer. She was too young for that anyway.

Beyond that, she certainly didn't approve of Harry's skiving off History of Magic to go frolic on the grounds with Hagrid. Considering the classroom was on the third floor Hermione let out a rending screech the first time he skived off. That may have been because it was in the middle of the lesson and Hermione didn't approve of such things, but mostly Harry thought it was because he went out the window. No one else seemed to notice it. Although Harry was sure it did wake Ron up, much to his further annoyance with the witch.

"I think I know what happened. You spread some cock and bull story hoping to lure Malfoy out and get him in trouble. I suppose you think it's good fun that Neville here believed it too?" Harry's whole frame went rigid. The look of betrayal on Neville's face nearly broke Harry right there. It took every ounce of self-control not to jump over the desk and pummel the offending professor into apologizing for her comments. He locked eyes with her and any sense of ambivalence was gone. His green eyes took on a cold look. She was very lucky she was family, if distant enough.

"Professor, you will apologize to Neville for suggesting his friends would betray him like that. He was putting the well-being of the Pride above his personal safety. Where I come from we reward that sort of thing. I don't expect a tabby to understand the morals of sacrifice, but I would expect it from the Head of Gryffindor House."

The room, if possible, went quieter than before. Everyone at the room sat completely gob smacked. Filch looked almost gleeful at the ideas of what he might be able to do with the boy in front of him. Hermione sat too stunned to even comprehend what a bad idea that little speech was. Finally, Harry saw a flash of understanding and the beginnings of resolve dance across Neville's face. The boy's red eyes were no longer so puffy and his tears were locked firmly in place. He almost smiled. It would take years for Neville to finally tell his first and oddest friend what that speech meant to him.

Professor McGonagall, on the other hand, was livid. Her face currently was drawn up into something far more resembling Professor Snape than anything the stern Transfiguration professor had worn in nearly thirteen years. "Mr. Potter," her voice was deathly cold now. "I don't believe it is your place to demand anything. Detention for each of you and fifty points from Gryffindor... apiece and an extra fifty for you Potter." She spat the name as though it were something particularly loathsome.

The shocked and destroyed faces on his friends suddenly caused Harry to realise something very bad had happened, but what? It wasn't the detentions, Harry was sure of that. It couldn't be that McGonagall didn't seem to like him as much at the moment, maybe the House Points? Harry wished he understood why. In all the months here he still couldn't understand what they did.

"I can't believe I have to take two hundred points from my own house! You have destroyed the hard work of so many of your fellow classmates. I hope you understand that." The older woman's face now was not so much loathing as intense concern and disappointment. Harry's idea bulb lit up, maybe someone could finally explain what these points meant!

"Professor?" Harry began tentatively.

"What is it, Potter?" The anger was back, but not as strong.

"Does this mean we have to miss meals or get kicked out of the dormitories?"

"No, that isn't usual procedure. You are still here to learn are you not, Mr. Potter?" Mr., that was a good sign.

"Oh, then will the older students have mating privileges taken away? Or are our future mating rights in danger?"

Neville, Harry and Hermione were then witness to something only four other students had ever seen before: a sputtering, speechless Professor McGonagall.

"Mr. Potter! Would you please care to explain this perverse line of questions? I would have thought that you'd had quite enough trouble tonight without making jokes!"

Feeling her deep distress, Harry rushed to correct her. "No, I'm sorry, Professor. I'm just trying to understand the significance of the House Points."

"Mr. Potter that was explained at the opening feast. Were you in the Astronomy Tower for that too?" She was annoyed again. Harry hurried to explain.

"All you said there was that the house with the most points won a cup. You never said what happened if we lost points. Is the cup full of treats, or mice or something else really tasty? If we lose points what happens? I don't want mating rights taken away from the older years. I'll go without food if that helps."

McGonagall sat and stared at the oddest student she'd ever seen in these hallowed halls. He wasn't half giant, or a werewolf, or from a particularly notorious family. In fact the only claim he had was defeating the darkest wizard of all time when he was a baby, which she had heard, he dismissed as inconsequential. What on earth to make of him? She had been teaching for nearly thirty years now and knew all manner of students and this one didn't fit a mould. He was difficult to place most especially because he kept referring to her in either a manner of kinship, which she knew for a fact to be impossible, or as her Animagus Transformation. Nothing fit. Who was Harry Potter and where had he been for the last nine years? She knew Dumbledore said he was in an orphanage, but that didn't fit either. The Order had looked there first.

The only logical explanation was the Killing Curse that marked the young boy in front of her had driven him out of his mind. The only other explanation was he was possessed of a genius that merely simulated madness, much the same way Albus had. Neither of those fit, though. While he operated outside the normal confines of standard social behaviour for an eleven year old boy, there was a logic to it that defied madness and his genius was yet to come forth if that was the case. True the boy was exceptional at Transfiguration and Herbology, but no great talent at the rest of his courses. So what to make of him, she mused. If she were to be truly honest with herself she did have to admit this truly odd student showed an unusual loyalty and fiercely protective nature of those he called friends. If this were any other situation she would be proud, but not tonight.

"Mr. Filch, would you escort these students back to the Gryffindor common room and make sure they get there. I don't want to have to take any more points off my house tonight." She rubbed her nose in a fit of sleepiness and frustration.

Heading back to the common room Hermione and Neville were positive that the rest of the house was going to hate them. "This is the worst thing that could ever happen! I mean we were in the lead! For the first time in years Gryffindor could win the House Cup again!" Hermione wailed. There that damn cup was again, Harry thought. No one seemed to be able to positively explain why it was so important. They were still to be fed, given water and had a place to sleep. Harry was positive from his night time explorations of the castle that possession of the Cup was not necessary for human copulation. What is the purpose then?

"Neville, thank you," Harry said suddenly.

"What?! Why? All I did was cost us fifty points!" Neville nearly cried.

"Because you came out to help, even at personal risk you came out to make sure we were ok. That's the bravest thing I can think of. So, once again thank you."

Neville looked slightly less distressed. "You don't seem to be concerned about losing a hundred points in a night, Harry." he noted with almost awe.

"Well, they don't really matter, do they? And anyone who won't be friends with us over something that doesn't matter isn't worth being friends with in the first place," Harry nodded sagely.

"THEY DON"T REALLY MATTER?!" Hermione yelled so forcefully Harry was sure she was going to have a heart attack.

"Hermione, calm yourself, please." Harry's reply only seemed to antagonize the young witch further. "Could you please explain why the points are so important?"

"Well the house with the most wins the House Cup!"

"Yes, but what does the house with the least points lose?" He replied.

Hermione's brow furrowed in confusion. "I don't understand. They don't really lose anything..."

"We don't get served less, or have to sleep outside. The older years aren't forbidden from sexing in broom cupboards at all hours of the night."

"Harry, now isn't the time for jokes. Everyone is forbidden from... doing that. We're supposed to be helping our house win points! Not lose two hundred in a night..." She moaned pitifully. "They'll never forgive us, never..."

"Then they aren't worth worrying about. We helped a friend tonight. That's worth more than any old points. Besides, you still haven't explained what they do..."</pre>

<pre>The Dursleys immediately sensed my evil. This was particularly impressive since I took several months to properly remember my time as a dark lord, yet they deemed me a monster upon arriving on their doorstep.

Amid the humiliation of diaper changes, tentative steps, and lisping words, I took great satisfaction in my caretakers' building horror. Even as a baby, I could still strike fear into the hearts of filthy muggles.

It started small as I relearned the art of wandless magic. Forget to feed little Harry and Dudley's bottle explodes. Insult him and your tongue starts to swell up. Go ahead, lock him in a cupboard. He will always find his way out, and you will somehow find your way in.

Even misfortunes that could not possibly be my fault, such as Vernon's demotion at work, were attributed to my malice. I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful.

+

At that moment, the troll's club smashed through the door, which is the main weakness of most locking charms. I'll admit that I panicked. Trolls are magically resistant, the Weasley was far too small to serve as a human shield, and two deaths in ten years is far too many.

"Evanesco troll," I murmured. The troll disappeared.

Hero worship filled my minion's Weasley eyes. "Wicked."

Hermione asked, "Where did it go?"

I shrugged. "Where does anything that's vanished go?"

+

I approached Hermione, Ron trailing at my heels. She was cheerfully chatting with Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor House. I found it telling that the ghost of Gryffindor had been violently murdered while the ghost of Slytherin was a violent murderer.

+

"So we can go to a ghost party with rotted food but we can't go to the Halloween Feast?" Ron whined.

"Oh, hush, Ronald. You could have gone by yourself. Besides, Sir Nicholas' Death Day Party was a wonderful learning experience," Hermione chided.

He snorted. "Yeah, I learned that I never want to go again."

"…rip…tear…kill…"

I stopped in surprise. The Basilisk? If she was slithering around, it meant that someone else had been meddling in my Chamber of Secrets.

"…time to kill…"

"NO!" I hissed, "Bad snake! No killing."

Hermione glanced back. "Are you okay, Harry?"

"Oh, yes, I'm perfectly alright. Just, erm, clearing my throat. Probably shouldn't have tried the food at Nick's party…"

+

Quidditch, such a ridiculous game. It's entirely reliant upon the skill of the seeker, unless one team is ridiculously outmatched, in which case the seeker is superfluous.

Furthermore, the Quidditch games' points are far too tied into the House Cup, which irked me greatly during my first time as a student. There I was answering questions, acing tests, charming professors, and earning loads of points, only for one clumsy seeker to ruin our chances of winning.

I do not lose.

Therefore, I convinced the Ravenclaw and Slytherin seekers to sit on the field for a week while their chasers racked up so many points that one of our Houses would win even if the teachers blatantly cheated in favor of the others. That was the first year I won the House Cup for Slytherin and the reason that Hogwarts games are no longer allowed to last more than three days.

Pleased at my victory over foolishness, I'd cheerfully gone back to ignoring the sport.

+

"Since I am substituting for Professor Lupin for the seventh time in as many months, I will preemptively inform you that our topic next month will once again be werewolves," Severus said dourly.

"Can't we do something else?" Ron groaned.

"Ten points from Gryffindor for questioning a teacher."

I raised my hand. "I don't suppose we'll learn how to kill them? I feel like I know a lot about werewolves but am ill-equipped to destroy one."

Severus smiled thinly. "Yes, I do believe that will be the topic of our next lesson. Good question, Potter…Twenty points from Gryffindor."

Ron flailed his arms around in confusion, threatening to knock over my inkwell. "But you said it was a good question!"

"Ten more points for disrespect," Severus said, sweeping out of the room. I tried not to look too obviously pleased.

"Snape's a git," Ron said.

I shook my head, sighing. "Well, you can hardly blame him – what with his condition and all…"

"Huh?"

"He's obviously a werewolf," I said.

"Oh, Harry, that's ridiculous," Hermione huffed.

I raised a hand to silence her objections. "No need to cover for him. This is clearly a cry for help."

"You've gotta be kidding me," Seamus Finnegan said. "Snape's a werewolf?"

"Of course he is. That's why he's been teaching about them every time he substitutes. It's all he knows."

"He does seem to know an awful lot about werewolves," Longbottom mumbled, looking a bit green.

The class exploded into discussion, and I made sure to drag Hermione into the hallway before she finally exclaimed, "You don't seriously believe that Professor Snape is a werewolf?!"

"No, Hermione, that would be ridiculous," I said.

"Then why would you say something like that? People are absolutely awful about werewolves. Do you know what that kind of rumor could do to his reputation?"

"Yes, which is why I don't appreciate him trying to out Lupin."

She looked startled. "You know about that?"

"Snape's been teaching about werewolves for months, and Lupin's gone every full moon. I'm not an idiot," I said.

While I was growing concerned about my classmates' mental abilities, the truth is that I suspected Lupin long before his first class absence. You see, several of my minions were werewolves back when I was Lord Voldemort. I know the signs well.

+

Dumbledore sighed heavily. "I'm very disappointed in you, Harry."

He had once again summoned me to his office, but this time it seemed I was actually in trouble. I kept my eyes downcast so that he couldn't steal my thoughts. Come to think of it, I really needed to learn Occlumency at some point…and I still hadn't made that Horcrux.

Seeing that I wasn't going to answer, Dumbledore continued, "Why did you tell everyone about Professor Lupin's condition? Surely, you realized how much trouble that would cause him."

"I didn't tell everyone," I muttered. "I only told Snape. Though I admittedly should have suspected he couldn't be trusted with sensitive information considering he couldn't even keep his own lycanthropy secret."

"Professor Snape is not a werewolf," he said with a grandfatherly smile.

"No, I'm quite certain he is," I insisted. "He told me so himself. I asked if he'd been attacked by a werewolf, and he said yes."

Dumbledore coughed, no doubt trying to hide his shock at my brilliant deductions. "That aside, I have it on good authority that you announced Professor Lupin's secret to the Gryffindor Common Room."

"That's not my fault. They were asking where I'd been. What was I supposed to do: Lie? Lie, like a dirty Slytherin?"

Dumbledore accepted the insult without comment, which I assure you he never would have done when I was still Tom Riddle. "You still did not need to ruin a good man's reputation."

I stared at him incredulously. Usually, I would have meekly agreed and hoped to escape Dumbledore's wrath for one more day. However, he was acting even more insane than he usually pretended to be. "Headmaster, he turns into a ravenous monster that attacks students."

I had done many terrible things in my two lives, but I'd never accidently murdered children.

Dumbledore shook his head wearily. "You have to understand that he would normally never harm a student. So long as he takes his Wolfsbane –"

"But he didn't take it," I pointed out. "How do you even forget something like that?"

"It was a very stressful night. Miss Weasley had just gone missing, and with Sirius Black still on the loose…"

"You can't just panic every time a student goes missing!" I cried. "We would never get anything done, if we did that. We still haven't found those two Hufflepuffs."

I personally suspected the dementors.

+

I burst into the Gryffindor common room and approached my best minions.

"Ron," I barked. "I need you to organize a Quidditch game."

Ron jumped up from the couch, like a proper minion. He then ruined the effect by questioning me. "But I thought you hated Quidditch."

"This is a matter of vital importance."

"What could possibly be important about Quidditch?" Hermione asked.

"Dumbledore," I said, voice flat.

Ron scratched his head thoughtfully. "I guess I can get Dean, Seamus, and Neville. Ginny's always up for a game. The twins would usually be, too, but they're pretty focused on catching some master prankster, right now."

Hermione raised an eyebrow and asked, "Master prankster?"

Ron gestured towards the wall, where Fred and George were analyzing a tapestry with a variety of spells. "Yeah, apparently somebody tossed them into the wall last night. Percy got hit, too."

"I'm surprised no one did this earlier" – I sniffed disdainfully – "They're completely insufferable."

"Harry," Hermione said, "you do realize that was you, right?"

"What?"

"Last night, when you waved your wand and said 'accio Weasley…'"

She mimed the motion with her wand, and Ron fell into her with a startled squeak. Meanwhile, the twins stumbled and looked around the room with narrowed eyes. Hermione hastily lowered her arm, mumbling, "I probably shouldn't gesture with my wand."

+

Severus sneered at me from the corner of the room, sweeping forward only when everyone else had left. "You really are exactly like your father – an arrogant, conceited, reckless fool with no regard for your own or others' safety. But even he would not have been so moronic as to enter a dangerous magical competition. Repeatedly."

I gave him a lazy smile. Bantering with Severus was such fun. "Well, what can I say? I'm a typical Gryffindor, not a slimy Slytherin like you."

Severus's eyes flashed with fury, and he leaned in so close that spittle flew at my face. "Do you think this is a game, Potter?"

"Technically, it's a tournament," I said.

Severus drew back, almost physically reigning in his emotions. He was silent for several moments, his lip curled in disgust at what he was about to do. "I think it's about time you were actually punished. Twenty points from Slytherin."

My eyes widened. "You can't do that! I'm not even in that house."

Severus smiled cruelly, drawling, "Five more for your cheek," as he walked away.

"I don't understand," Hermione asked as we made our way towards the common room. "Why doesn't he just give you detention?"

I chuckled. "Oh, he tried that back in First Year. So long as he's there, I rather enjoy them, and, if they're unsupervised, I try to brew Felix Felicis and leave him to clean up the resulting poisons. The detentions are inevitably more of a punishment for him than me."

We passed through the portrait entrance. Inside, a party was in full swing. They'd been planning this ever since the tournament was first announced because the Hogwarts champion was obviously going to be a Gryffindor.

A cheer erupted when the partiers spotted us, and someone shoved a butterbeer in my hand. I grinned, announcing, "My plan has finally come to fruition. Snape has decided to take points from Slytherin every time I annoy him. We are going to sweep the Cup for the NEXT FOUR YEARS!"

A second cheer went up, and a few people slapped me on the back. They soon turned their attention towards a keg of Weasley-smuggled firewhiskey. As we jostled our way through the crowd, Hermione said, "Harry, you weren't actually planning…"

"Nope."

"So you've just suddenly stopped rooting for Slytherin?"

"I came to a very important realization today," I said. "It doesn't matter what color the Great Hall is during the Leaving Feast or who gets bragging rights for the next year. What matters is that I am the one who decides."

+

"Anything interesting in the news today?" I asked.

"You really should get a subscription of your own," Hermione sniffed.

"Everyone knows the Daily Prophet is full of rubbish."

"It's very important to keep informed," she said.

I shrugged. "I have people for that."

Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You mean me?"

"Well, yes, mostly you at the moment," I admitted.

Back when I was a dark lord, I used to have a whole group of Death Eaters performing that task. I also had a group that dealt with public relations. My decision to put Bellatrix in the latter group probably explains why I was considered a dark lord and not a slightly over-zealous politician.

+

I raised a hand. "Down, Weasleys. I can handle this."

They reluctantly acquiesced. I stared at the Gryffindor through my shimmering shield charm. "Tell me, have I ever been quoted as saying that Lord Voldemort is back? Have you ever seen me say that? Am I saying it now?"

He appeared confused. "So you're saying he isn't, then?"

I chuckled. "Well, I wouldn't go that far. I certainly saw some snake-like man burst from a cauldron. However, I cannot say with certainty that he was Voldemort. I've never even seen a photograph of the man."

"There aren't many of them around, and they're almost never in the history books," Hermione said.

Ron snorted. "Not surprising, is it? It's bloody creepy when he smiles and waves at you."

I've always loved having my picture taken.

The Gryffindor cleared his throat. "But Dumbledore said that you said that Voldemort was back."

"Dumbledore is clearly trying to manipulate you all. I am neutral on the Voldemort issue. Tell all of your friends."

The Gryffindor, still looking dazed, wandered off.

Ron nodded, standing tall as though he had just chased the boy away single-handedly. Hermione said, "That should quiet some of the louder Gryffindors."

I quirked an eyebrow.

"You were in your trunk," Ginevra said.

I sighed. "Trust Dumbledore to sabotage my reputation."

The redhead tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Well, he hasn't done a very good job. The Gryffindors are mostly behind you, already. The Hufflepuffs think you're lying. But you insult them in public, so you never stood a chance there. The Ravenclaws who are lucid enough to understand what's going on are reserving judgment. And the Slytherins believe you because Voldemort killed most of their parents."

I hummed thoughtfully. "Yes, I suppose we have that in common."

+

"Hem, hem," Umbridge hem-hemed.

I turned Most Potente Potions to page four hundred and twelve.

"Hem, hem."

A flick of my wand sent three small fires dancing atop my desk. I glanced up disdainfully at her toad-like face. "What is it?"

"Can you tell me, Mr. Potter, why a cauldron is on top of your desk?"

I frowned, adjusting it slightly so that the fires evenly heated its pewter sides. "Felix Felicis is very sensitive to altitudes. This isn't ideal, but it'll have to do."

She pursed her lips so that they looked a bit like a duck's bill. "And why aren't you reading your textbook?"

"I already did that," I said.

"In this class, we read the textbook," she said slowly, smiling as if I couldn't sense her evil intentions.

"Yes, which is why everyone hates your class" – I turned around to the seat behind me – "Right, Hermione?"

"Harry! You can't say things like that to professors."

I turned triumphantly back to Umbridge. "If she didn't hate your class, she would have said that. For instance, she'll never accept that Potions might as well be self-study."

Hermione huffed. "Potions is a perfectly reasonable subject, which requires a teacher to ensure its students' safety."

"See? We all hate your class. I would blame the curriculum, but I don't think we have one of those. You're just a terrible teacher."

Her chest heaved up and down in fury. "How dare you –"

"It's not just me. Snape agrees, and he should know. He's a terrible teacher, too."

Umbridge said, "I have absolutely no interest in the opinions of a half-breed werewolf."

I laughed at her idiocy. "Snape is a full werewolf. There's no such thing as a half werewolf, and you would know that if you knew anything about your subject."

"Detention, Mr. Potter!" she cried.

I glared. "Fine, we'll talk about werewolves. Maybe you'll even learn something."

"But the only way to seal a werewolf bite is with a mixture of powdered silver and dittany. Mind you, it doesn't do much good against –"

Umbridge interrupted, and I was suddenly quite certain that she hadn't been listening at all. "Your detention will be very simple. You will write 'I must not interrupt class.'"

"There wasn't a class to interrupt."

"You will write it as many times as it takes to sink in," she said tightly, pulling out a thin, black quill.

I gestured widely with my wand. "It's sunk in. Can I go?"

"Five hundred lines, then," she said.

I sighed gustily and took the quill.

I was aware that arguing would only irritate her further, a secondary goal, but I knew a blood quill when I saw one. And that complaint had given me just enough time to cast an invisible glove charm, most commonly used by Potions Masters. You see, a blood quill is always attached to the last person whose skin touched it.

In this case, Professor Umbridge.

I smirked and wrote the first line. Umbridge yelped. I wrote the second.

"Mr. Potter!"

I wrote the third, humming merrily under my breath.

"Stop that! Stop that right this instant!" Umbridge shrieked.

I looked up from the parchment, absentmindedly doodling. "What is it, Professor?"

She trembled with rage, clutching her injured hand. "Give me the quill."

I smiled congenially. "Are you bleeding?"

+

I stormed into Dumbledore's office, summons in hand, and slammed it down upon the old man's desk. "I don't care what Umbridge has told you! Pensieve memories can be faked, and everyone knows that Veritaserum doesn't work on sociopaths."

Dumbledore remained calm, a trait which was as unwavering as it was frustrating. "Mr. Potter –"

"I have done nothing, and I will testify to this under Veritaserum."

The phoenix screeched in irritation, and I screeched back to establish dominance. Dumbledore said, "Mr. Potter, this meeting does not concern Professor Umbridge."

"Oh," I said. "That's good because I haven't done anything."

He offered me a lemon drop. "Yes, I know. You were quite vocal about that earlier."

I spoke slowly. "I don't suppose you're planning to teach me Dark Magic?"

His eyes twinkled. "No, I'm afraid not. Although Miss Weasley did enlighten me about your unique definition for the term."

+

Ron grabbed the paper from Luna, revealing the headline: Umbridge attacks apprentice; flees country; resigns in disgrace.

A very Weasley frown crossed Ron's face. "Ginny, what did you do?"

"I apologized," Ginevra said.

"You what?" I said.

"I sent a letter for you to Rita Skeeter, apologizing on the behalf of Dumbledore for lying to us all and Hermione for trying to kill her."

"Without my permission?"

"Well, I figured that, if it didn't work, we could always say that I was a minion of one of your political enemies," she said. "It did, though, so I'm your publicist now! Of course, I did have to make a few concessions to get this article through. You have to do an interview this summer, and Skeeter gets to attend our wedding."

I glanced up from the paper. "What was that last demand?"

She beamed. "You've got an interview."

"Right," I muttered. "I can do that."

+

Slughorn transformed back into himself, though he took up nearly as much space as the armchair had. "Ah, Albus. Good to see you, good to see you."

"You as well," he said. "And may I introduce young Harry Potter?"

Slughorn's eyes lit up, and he grabbed my hand in both his. "Wonderful meeting you, Mr. Potter. I've heard you like Quidditch. I happen to be personally acquainted with a Puddlemere United Chaser. Perhaps you would like to meet him?"

"I may be interested, in the future. I'm very busy, you know."

"Of course, of course," he chuckled. "Defeating Dark Lords and all that. Now, if that will be all, I really must be going."

Dumbledore looked around the ruined home. "I'm afraid I rarely have time for social visits lately. I'm here to offer you your old position. There's no place safer than Hogwarts –"

"Tell that to the Perks girl," I muttered.

"–and you're clearly in hiding from Voldemort."

Slughorn chortled. "Yes, well, you see…I'm actually not. I was hiding from you. An old acquaintance of mine mentioned in passing that you might be paying me this visit."

Dumbledore heaved a heavy sigh, as if he actually felt bad about manipulating everyone around him. "I am terribly sorry to interrupt your retirement, but I'm afraid we're desperate. If you don't take the post, Harry Potter will. And he's not allowed in the Potions room unsupervised."

"To be fair," I said, "no one died, and I was the one who reconstructed the floor."

Slughorn frowned, shifting his great weight from foot to foot. "Won't the Ministry give you someone, if no one else applies?"

"I think I would prefer Harry," Dumbledore admitted. "Our last replacement was less than exemplary."

+

"Ginevra?" I threatened.

"I wouldn't ever betray you," Ginevra assured me. "I owe you way too much."

She really was a very good minion. Loyal, cunning, mildly insane, even somewhat attra…I shoved away my plate.

"Ginevra, did you put love potion in my eggs?"

"No," she said, shaking her head. "I haven't got all the ingredients yet."

"If I find out that you're lying…"

"Harry, if I had dosed you with Mum's potion, you would be kissing me right now. It's a really good potion."

I nodded stiffly, glaring back down at the note. Did Silencing Charms not work on portraits? Or were the walls spying for Dumbledore, as well?

"Bloody hell, the Death Eaters were right!" Ron exclaimed.

I smirked. "Out of all my friends, I should have known that you would be the one to become a Blood Purist."

+

"What in Merlin's name happened?" I snapped.

"Apparently, an uninvited guest flooing into the Slytherin common room sends the entire castle into lockdown," Severus said. "We were stuck there for hours."

I frowned. "Has Lucius been captured, then?"

"No, my lord. When Dumbledore arrived to interrogate him, Lucius claimed that he was doing a surprise inspection for the Board of Governors. There was some suspicion when it turned out that the Board had not been aware of this, but he reminded us all that he did say it was a surprise," Severus drawled.

"That's Lucius. He's always been good at slithering out of trouble," Sirius said.

"Indeed. Now, why is Lucius not reporting his failure to me personally?" I stroked my wand, causing the entire group to shudder, save Sirius. There is a reason he's my right-hand man, after all.

Severus said, "He was invited to dinner, and Dumbledore expects him to perform a slightly less surprising inspection of the school before he leaves."

"How unfortunate," I muttered.

"In happier news," Severus said, "Potter nearly got himself killed doing some sort of Dark ritual."

It had been fifty-seven years since I'd visited the Hospital Wing, but it hadn't changed much. The sickly smell of potions filled the air, mingling with the citrus scent left by years of heavy cleaning charms. The bed was slightly too hard, to subtly discourage students from lingering, and, even through the bandages, I could still see its painfully white walls.

I heard Hermione lean towards me from her perch in the visitor's chair. "What have you learned today?"

"There's a reason wizards wear glasses. Eyes are complicated," I said.

She snorted. "True. What else?"

"Don't just read the summary of a ritual in the book. There might be warnings or better instructions later on," I said.

"What else?"

I frowned. "I can't think of anything else. I'm pretty sure those are the only things I learned from this experience."

"How about: Don't perform an untested ritual in the middle of a school-wide lockdown? Honestly, Harry, what were you thinking?!"

I shrugged. "I didn't want to be disturbed. It's not like I was invisible this time."

"Madame Pomfrey couldn't get to you for hours," Hermione said. "You could have died."

"Probably not died," I said. "Lost my eyes, maybe, but then I could just get better ones. Like Moody's."

"You are not getting fake, magical eyes."

I chuckled. "Well, obviously not now. The ritual didn't go that badly."

Hermione was silent for a time, probably reading. She does that a lot. "Harry, what was wrong with your old eyes?"

"Well, I did need glasses, and I wanted night vision."

"Why do you need night vision? You don't even do anything at night."

"Of course not. Without night vision, that would be stupid," I said.

I heard a soft smacking sound, likely Hermione's palm striking her forehead.

"I'm fairly certain there's no such thing as an immunity to love potions," Hermione said.

"Of course there is," I said. "You just tie yourself up and throw up every time it happens. Eventually, you become nauseous the second you feel the effects of a love potion."

Hermione's lips pursed, and her eyes grew distant as if solving a complex Arithmancy equation. "So…anytime you feel love, then?"

I shrugged. "I guess. Isn't it different when a potion causes it?"

"I'm not sure," Hermione said, appearing deeply concerned at her lack of knowledge.

Meanwhile, Ron's wailing had apparently overpowered my Silencing Charm.

"Romilda Vane!" he cried. It could have been worse, I suppose. At least he wasn't in love with his sister.

The Sorting Hat's New Song!

For those who are quite brave, or just wish to look cool,

The red and gold of Gryffindor is your place in this school.

And Ravenclaw tower, home of the birds,

Makes room for the mad and for the nerds.

For those who have no talent or simply feel divided,

If no one else will take you, then it's Hufflepuff decided.

Finally, there's Slytherin, who wanted Purebloods who were cunning and ambitious, but apparently eleven-year-olds don't usually have those qualities. So, mostly, he just got Purebloods, no matter how terrible. Fortunately, we have standards now.

…Wow!

The newly-crowned Aunt Hermione Granger-Weasley, Dark Lady and Minister of Magic for the British Isles, smiled at my progeny. "She's adorable, Harry. What's her name?"

"Well, we decided that she needed a grand and terrifying title, much like Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. So I named her after all of my greatest enemies."

Ron Weasley, conman and former werewolf, gaped at my brilliance. "You WHAT?"

Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose. "What did you end up with?"

"Her name is Severus Albus Lily Luna Lord Voldemort Potter."

Ginevra smiled. "We call her Sally for short."

"That's as many syllables as she can remember," I said fondly.

Ginevra giggled, kissing me on the cheek and not minding in the least as I flinched away.

Hermione frowned and said, "How are your mother and Luna considered enemies?"

I shrugged. "They don't precisely fit the theme, but Ginevra insisted."

Although, Lily did slay me when I was a dark lord, and I'm pretty sure Luna tried to kill me once or twice.</pre>

<pre>Harry chuckled at the letter and wrapped his hand around the pouch that was still hanging from his neck. "Well that's one less thing to worry about..." he muttered to himself as he grabbed another letter from the box.

Harry,

I saw that you were the Griffin who saved me. I know that we were never enemies in school despite the feelings of our houses, but we definitely weren't friends. Still, you threw yourself into danger and saved my life. Someone who was practically a total stranger. I will never forget. Once my leg is all better you should come visit me.

I'll fuck you.

Straight up.

Maybe I'll even get my friend Daphne to join in….

- T. Davis

Harry's eyebrows shot up and he had to reposition the way he was sitting to hide the increased blood flow to his lower regions.

"Oh wow…..that's um…..flattering…..Hey uncle Moony? What's the…uh…..social protocol here? Do I have to respond to this? Send a polite decline?" Harry asked as he handed the letter over.

Remus's eyebrows also raised as he read the letter. "I think….it's better to just not respond at all. In fact I'd probably get rid of this before Hermione comes back."

Harry paled at the thought of his girlfriend reading the offer. "Yeah...that's probably smart."</pre>

<pre>"You can cut the monologue Lucius," he flatly said, interrupting the man, "If you want to use my actions this summer as leverage against me then you should remember that I am well aware of your involvement in the Hogwarts Massacre, and I will have no compunctions sharing it with anyone I need to."

Harry could feel Malfoy still beside him for a second before he replied, "Such accusations shouldn't be made lightly-"

"Come on Lucius. Are we going to play this game again?" Harry said, interrupting Malfoy again. Lucius was a creature of words, and not letting him say what he wanted to say could throw him off more than he'd admit. It was up to Harry to use this to his advantage. "You and I both know that you wanted to test me, and as ill thought out as doing what you did was, test me you did. I'm still here. Not a scratch. Besides, I have a feeling that you knew what you were giving Lisa Turpin. Or at least who it belonged to."

There was no mistaking it this time. Lucius had completely frozen.

"A . . . diary perhaps?" Harry carried on, "Belonging to your old Master. An artefact that you knew was capable of dangerous things, but didn't know how."

"How do you know what it was?" Lucius asked, his voice considerably lower than before.

Harry smiled. It was time for his bullshitting ability to shine, "I had a nice long chat with the spirit of your old master that resided in that diary before I erased him from existence."

"You what?"

"It was quite enlightening actually. He was quite insistent about his superiority over me right until I destroyed him. I don't presume your Master will be happy about you being the cause of the destruction of such a . . . valuable artefact . . . when he returns."

Lucius was outright staring at him now, his eyes filled with fear, "You're lying. You are making this up. "

Harry chuckled, ignoring Lucius's statement, "Its rather funny actually. Throughout this entire sequence of events, nothing went right for you. I broke into your home. The Heir started attacking purebloods. You put your son in danger, and ended up killing several of your allies' children. Even your desperate attempt at getting Lisa killed failed completely."

Lucius's eyes widened, "It was you. But how? You were in the court at the time!"

"I have my people Lucius, and unlike Voldemort's, mine are actually competent."</pre>

<pre>"Harry," started Dumbledore.

"Yes, Albus?" countered Harry.

The two Professors reared in shock. "Mr. Potter! What sort of rudeness and arrogance is this? You have no leave to use his first name!"

"Neither has he, Deputy Headmistress. Only my family and friends are allowed to use my name. Albus, here, is neither, nor will he ever be." Harry's smooth yet scathing reply shocked them further. "I have reminded him before, that he is to address me as Mr. Potter or Lord Potter, and that it is inappropriate for him to do otherwise. I have no intention of any niceties with him. If he calls me Mr. Potter, I will call him Headmaster. If he calls me Lord Potter, I shall call him Vassal Dumbledore. I don't see why there is any ambiguity regarding my outright intentions and statements." That set the tone of the meeting on Harry's part. He had made it clear that he did not hold Dumbledore in any regard whatsoever.</pre>

<pre>Very much in keeping with the Marauder nature and name, the four new holders of the map were trying to find their way into the girls' dormitory. The discovery had come by accident and that too in the Ravenclaw tower. Harry had been allowing Luna to treat him as her pet so as to scare her dorm-mates silly. Giving in to animal instincts proved to be a masterstroke. The protections on the staircases which could detect animagi, registered an animal instead of a boy. Harry had used that to streak up to right outside Hermione's dorm, and had tried to console her. Lavender, Sally and Parvati had protested against his presence, however, and that proved detrimental. Very highly irritated by that, Harry decided to cheer Hermione and shut the others up with a Hamper. Pushing all his intent and lot of magic and concentration into making Hermione happy and pleasing her, he brought out four sets of Happiness Hampers, directing one at each girl. The blooming, blissful smiles on their faces were reward enough. What he hadn't bargained for was for the girls, especially Hermione, to start off with the same guilty smiles as those that the girls on the train given when they had revived Astoria. Harry wrongly decided that he hadn't done enough, and reiterated his actions. This time, the girls couldn't control themselves. They had to give in to the pleasure, and duly collapsed onto their beds, moaning slightly and tossing and twitching, with gigantic expressions of happiness, as soon as he left.

Unknown to Harry, he had just gained four very enthusiastic witches for a harem if he ever wanted to create one.</pre>

<pre>Every single person in the room was shocked to hear Harry speaking that way. So shocked were they, in fact, that they couldn't get a chastisement out of their mouths. Harry would swear every so often, but telling Albus Dumbledore to shut the fuck up? Then again, a Basilisk's bite was probably a good enough didn't let them dwell on that though.

"Mr. Weasley, thank you for your unexpected, but not unwelcome intervention. I meant to trap Malfoy and had the plan ready from the time that we came out of the Chamber. Nobody harms my family. Anyone foolish enough to attempt it will be totally, utterly, destroyed, annihilated or whatever similar word you may choose. He hurt Hermione and Ginny. Now Death will be too kind for Mr. Malfoy. He will be taken down piece by piece."

His words delivered in a silky, maliciously nonchalant manner sent shivers down everyone's spine. A minute later, Amelia Bones along with Aurors Hestia Jones and Herbert Adams stepped out of the Floo and looked happy to finally get her hands on the elusive Malfoy. "Chief Bones, if I may."

"Indeed Mr. Potter."

"How did this bastard-"

"Mr. Potter!" reprimanded Professor McGonagall in a scandalised tone. It was only for show, of course. Minerva herself wanted to call Lucius Malfoy worse than just 'bastard' when the blonde-haired ponce was a wee firstie.

"Sorry Professor. How did this upstanding, honourable bastard-"

"Language, Harry!" Molly scolded. He pouted and grimaced at her.

"How did this criminal slip through the hands of Law last time?"

"He claimed to be under the Imperius Curse."</pre>

<pre>"Your honours, while the evidence, unfortunately, speaks for itself, I intent to show that Mister Potter should not be held to the same standards of punishment that might usually be meted out for such a crime. Since Mister Potter has entered our world, he has shown himself to be a talented and resourceful student who, unfortunately, has allowed envy to fester into magical mental instability and dark arts experimentation, and then to make the terrible misjudgement we are here today to judge on."

Harry glared at him. Oh, how he'd like to light that stupid beard on fire.

"I would further go on to make the case that Mister Potter can, and should, serve only minimum sentence before being placed in long term mental care in St Mungo's."

Amelia eyed Dumbledore for slightly longer than one might expect before turning to Mrs. Ogden. "Prosecution, please."

"Your honours…" Mrs Ogden glanced at Dumbledore. "…Given the clear and cut nature of the evidence available, we find it very difficult to push for even a paucity sentence…"

Harry glanced at Dumbledore's face as Mrs Ogden carried on. Shock, confusion, slowly forming anger. Heh.

"…Thus we intent to show how what the evidence we do have seems to suggest…"

— DP & SW: TFoP —

What the hell? Dumbledore stared as Mrs Ogden went on and on. Red mist descended as he realised what was going on. He was being set up. All those conversations with Greengrass had just been diversions! The Gray had no intention of sending Harry through the veil. But why! The Gray shouldn't want anything to do with Harry — he'd made sure of that. A bead of sweat ran down his neck. Unless Harry's performance at the duelling tournament had convinced Lord Slytherin to recruit the boy, even despite the business with Miss Greengrass. Ugh. This wasn't good.

"…With a full exoneration." Mrs. Ogden wrapped up her opening statement.

Dumbledore's beard twitched. On the other hand, Amelia did not look happy with the prosecution, did she?

All around the court room, a faint muttering could be heard.

Amelia glared between him and Mrs. Ogden. She looked to her two other judges who nodded back before sounding another blast with her wand. "Okay, stop. I want to know right now why the defence is playing prosecution and the prosecution is playing defence."

Albus jabbed a finger towards Mrs. Ogden. "Your honour, the prosecution assured me they would be pushing for the veil—"

Gasps sounded around the court room.

"—And I prepared my defence based on avoiding that. This is hugely irregular!"

Mrs. Ogden glared. "And how regular is it, may I ask, for the defence of a client to be handled by someone who admits in their opening statement that all the evidence points towards their client being guilty?" She looked towards Regent Bones. "How is someone supposed to get a fair trail when their own defence believes them to be guilty and is pushing for that result despite their own client's plea of not-guilty — even when there is plenty of evidence clearly showing them to be, in fact, not guilty."

Dumbledore's nose flared. They were going to use the wand as evidence, weren't they? Damn it. He needed to think of someway around that. He needed—

"Dumbledore?" Amelia's voice cut through his thinking. "Is there evidence that shows Mister Potter to be innocent?"

He grit his teeth. "Your honour, the interpretation of the evidence might, in certain circumstance, lead one to cast a doubt over Mister Potter's guilt, but the unfortunate reality of the situation—"

Bang! Amelia gave yet another blast on her wand, cutting him off. She leaned forward and rubbed her temples with the tips of her fingers before straightening. "I can't believe I'm doing this." She sent a mild glare towards Lord Greengrass who watched intently from the visitor's gallery, before speaking again. "Mister Dumbledore, Mrs. Ogden, please step away from your lecterns."

— DP & SW: TFoP —

Harry watched from the middle of the room, still chained to the chair, as Amelia Bones ordered Dumbledore and Mrs. Ogden to step away from their lecterns. What was she planning to do? Hopefully not rule a miss-trial. That would suck.

A visibly agitated Dumbledore snapped his book shut with such force it snapped a clump of his beard too, causing the headmaster to flinch and Harry to smirk.

"Now, please walk forward and don't stop walking until I tell you to."

Dumbledore and Mrs. Ogden walked forward in total silence. No one in the court seemed to be even breathing.

"Stop."

They stopped.

"Now please turn around and walk to your new lecterns."

They did so, Dumbledore looking both annoyed and uncertain. He put the book down, still closed, on the lectern and Harrys eyes sharpened with the unrealised and unkown talent of a snitch seeking prodigy. Several hairs from the headmaster's long, white beard were trapped in the book's pages, just visible against the black leather of the book's cover.

"Now." Amelia smiled primly. "Prosecution," she turned to Dumbledore, "if you would please start submitting evidence."

Harry tore his eyes away from the hairs and back towards Amelia Bones, a small smirk playing across his lips.

Dumbledore breathed out sharply in exasperation. "Your honour, you can not be serious. I am not prepared to act as prosecution, regardless of what they"—he motioned towards Mrs. Ogden—"might have you believe."

"This is our court room, Albus, I am totally serious. You were going to try and prove that Mister Potter here—an eleven year old child—should be given several years in Azkaban. I'm sure some would say that if you came here ready to push that, then you came here ready to be prosecution."

"I was appointed by Lord Potter—"

"—We will not have our courtroom become a circus! Nothing has changed except where you stand, and what I'm calling you." Regent Bones glanced towards Harry's parents who he noticed with interest looked extremely confused. "Now, please get on with it."</pre>

<pre>"The Killing Curse strips the soul from the body and banishes it to the afterlife. You had the unique situation of having two souls in your body. One of you must stay. The other may return. I will hear both souls arguments for their return and decide which has the stronger claim to life. Between you and me: that piece of Riddle's soul does not have the capacity to argue its case, broken as it is, so all you have to do is convince us that you have a reason to go back. Even Ephialtes would be able to win a debate without an opponent!" Harry saw that Ephialtes features were starting to purple at Gaius' repeated insults and decided to get out of here before the two really came to blows.

"I suppose the reason I want, no, I need to go back is that Hermione is still in danger. I would give my life for her...I suppose I already did, come to that, but now I am asking you to let me return to life for her." Gaius once again had an approving look on his face.

"Well put, lad. A poignant plea. Since Tom Marvolo Riddle's soul piece has no way to present a superior claim I judge that yours is the stronger and you may choose to return." he proclaimed. Harry looked around surreptitiously for a door or some other portal that might take him back. "Just follow the pull of your soul bond, lad. You'll find her." Gaius said.</pre>

<pre>"Well what would you do then?" Hermione was clearly put out with the flaws he was pointing out.

"I would model the whole thing on the RSPCA. Maybe call it the Magical Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Elves and have better treatment of elves rather than their freedom be the main goal of the organization." Hermione was staring at him with a slightly open mouth.

"Why have you been forcing me to hound you about your studies for three years if you're obviously intelligent enough not to need me?" He could see a slight smile pulling at the corners of her lips taking any sting out of her remark.

"Maybe I just needed an excuse to keep you around? Besides I do need you. You really are a much better student than I am." Hermione actually looked pleased at his response and her cheeks gained a light pink dusting. It was all true too. He wasn't anywhere near as smart as she thought, he just had a head start. "Now are there any more things that I've forgotten to tell you that you had a burning questions about? I don't like it when we argue this much." He had meant it as a joke but Hermione turned serious.

"Actually there was one more thing. What is this deal you have with Rita Skeeter that she mentioned in her note?" Damn. I forgot that she would have seen that. It was only the size of a newspaper front page, after all.

"Ah, well, Rita has a bit of a reputation." Harry began.

"She's a stain on the journalistic community, you mean. It's people like her that make others doubt sightings of the Crumple-Horned Snorcack!" Luna broke in. Hermione looked like she had her own opinion on people's reasons to doubt a Crumple-Horned Snorcack sighting but didn't say anything.</pre>

<pre>"Hey, Scarhead! Like our badges?!" At Malfoy's shout all the Slytherins made sure to turn in such a way that Harry could see all their badges. The entire corridor was filled with glowing letters proclaiming:

SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY:
THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION

"That isn't all they do though. Watch this!" All the Slytherins pressed their badges and the messages changed. Harry lightly placed a hand on Hermione's forearm to keep her from reacting. He already knew how he would handle this. He calmly waited until each badge was winking the same message back at him.

POTTER STINKS!

Harry raised one eyebrow at Malfoy who seemed almost giddy with anticipation.

"That's it? That's the best you could do in a week? That's…adorable." Malfoy wasn't the only person in the hallway looking shocked. Harry's voice had been cold and silky in a way that Snape could only ever hope to achieve. It slithered around them like a snake which to the smarter Slytherins meant a strike was coming. A twinge of unease began forming in those best at reading the mood of a room.

"WHAT?!" Nobody would ever accuse Draco Malfoy of that kind of awareness though.

"I'm serious, Malfoy. It's like watching a niffler trying to use tools. I'd give you a pat on the head for your hard work but I just washed my hands."

"Like you could do any better, you disgusting half-blood!" Harry grinned dangerously and drew his wand causing Malfoy to scramble for his. Harry though wasn't looking to get in a duel just yet.

"You mean just off the top of my head? Let's see." With a wave of his wand fiery letters formed in the air between them.

SUPPORT DRACO MALFOY:
AMATEUR HAIRDRESSER, AMATEUR WIZARD

The Gryffindors in the corridor started laughing loudly as the blond ponce spluttered in an absolute rage.

"No? Perhaps this then." With another wave of his wand Harry changed the message. Attention switched back to the letters he had conjured earlier as the shifted.

SUPPORT THE MALFOY PARENTS:
THE SHAME IS CRIPPLING

"Feels more appropriate, doesn't it, Malfoy? How do your parents live with it by the way?" The Gryffindors were absolutely howling by now and Harry noticed more than a few Slytherins snickering along with them. Malfoy looked like he was about to have an aneurism. When the blond ponce started moving Harry was ready. He had a small reflective shield formed at the tip of his wand that he could use to bat the coming jinx away. It was something he had learned indirectly from Riddle over the course of their confrontations and it was the best way Harry could think of to make sure there were no nasty surprises. It also happened to look thoroughly intimidating which was something else he wanted to achieve here.

Snape hauled his godson to his feet and thrust the boy's wand back at him before glaring the students into the classroom. Before he entered in behind them he dispelled the burning words that still hung in the air, privately thinking that Potter might have hit closer to the mark than he intended.</pre>

<pre>How to casually leave this conversation before it could go any farther than pleasantries?

"Well, I best get back to it before―" Harry was saved from his attempt at basic human interaction by a sharp scream. It sounded vaguely of a child's shriek of terror and a bird-of-prey's battle-cry; it even warbled a bit at the end like a distressed songbird. It was also the exact scream Justin always gave when he saw Granger approaching from a distance and had time to work up a good, long shout.

Harry was proven correct when Justin came tearing through a tall hedge bush on the other side of the courtyard like his arse had been set on fire, wailing like a firetruck. Dean and Morag soon followed, Morag holding her robe hem up so it wouldn't obstruct her running and Dean wearing half a suit of armour ― that he likely 'borrowed' from the hallway ― while the other half was in his arms, both also screaming like lunatics.

Harry saw Granger paused a distance away, likely wearing the expression of confusion and irritation she always affected when Harry and his friends got up to what she called 'absolute nonsense.' Speaking of running away . . .

Harry tipped an imaginary hat at the befuddled older girls, saying, "Ladies," before he climbed out of the fountain and ran, dripping wet, away as fast as he could.

Not two seconds later, he heard the pounding of feet behind him and looked back to realize with astonishment that the two girls were running away with him, confused fright on their faces.

"Why are you running?" he shouted over his shoulder, not slowing down. Smaller than them though he was, Harry was faster.

Craig shot him an incredulous look. She called, "A herd of first years just ran screaming as if they had just seen the face of evil. I don't care what exactly it was that had you all running, good sense dictates that we run too!"

MacDuff nodded as she panted. They were now streaking through the Charms Courtyard, forcing groups people to jump aside lest they be run over. MacDuff eventually asked in a winded tone, "What are we running from anyway?"

Harry couldn't contain a grin as he thought of Granger's look of anger when confronted with his irreverence. "Craig wasn't far off the mark! 'The face of evil' is exactly what we should call it."</pre>

'Oh well,' Harry thought with a sigh. That was a quest for another day.

For now, he was just glad that this whole mess was almost over. It was time to head back home, kick loose, and harass Perenelle for some cake.

<pre>"Right. Then, shall we move on to our main point of business?"

Alex's eyes hardened. "The Black Library."

Slytherin nodded. "Do you know what the fidelius charm is?"

She nodded back. "Luna told me."

"The easiest way to keep the library safe is to have me cast a fidelius charm around the Black Library and make you the secret keeper."

Alex eyes brightened. "That's brilliant! Then he'd never even be able to find it!"

Slytherin nodded.

Alex's face fell. "But, how would you get into the house? I can't let you in and my father certainly wouldn't allow it, and even if he did and you came back later, the wards would still say that you've been there, and I'm pretty sure using such a charm on someone else's property is illegal."

Slytherin sat back in his chair. "That's where it gets tricky and there's no safe way to do it. There are easy ways, but they're not safe."

Alex leaned forwards. "What are those ways?"

"The easiest way is for you spend a few months memorising every inch of the library with your occlumency, if its good enough. Then I place you under the imperious curse and cast the charm for you."

Alex paled. The words of her Grandfather came back to her — do not allow yourself to be trapped. "I…I don't know if I'm comfortable with that."

"Like I said, the easy, but unsafe way."

"What's the hard way?"

Slytherin shrugged. "Smuggle every single book out of the library over the next few months without your father noticing. But then you have to place the library at risk from outside parties. Probably myself, and I wouldn't recommend you do that."

Alex hesitated. That had been a very honest recommendation.

"Of course, you take a risk with the imperious-fidelius method too. I might make myself the secret keeper rather than you."

Alex shifted in her seat. "Are there any other methods?"

Slytherin started counting off on his fingers. "Use your occlumency to memorise every single book in the next few months and then write them all out again later…"

Alex blanched. Not possible.

"…Persuade your father not to get rid of the books…"

Urgh. If she tried to do that, he'd probably just speed up his plans.

"…Arrange for your father to have an accident…"

She looked at Slytherin in horror.

"…Which obviously isn't an option, but I'm just listing them all off…"

She nodded quickly

"…Arrange for your father to fall in love with someone you control and indirectly control him through her…

She snorted. That wasn't happening.

"…Have a law passed that somehow makes his course of action against the law, which as head auror he'd be forced to comply with…"

She raised her eyebrows.

"…Not a chance…"

Her shoulder's fell.

"…Infiltrate the ministry department that he'd give the books to, probably the department of mysteries, and have your agents give the books back to you once your father handed them over…"

Magical Merlin, this was getting ridiculous.

"…Find a place in the house that your father doesn't know about or can't get in and move the books there instead…"

The Black Magic room! Oh… but her father did know about it, he just never went there. She scowled. Plus, it was too small.

"…Learn the fidelius charm yourself…"

She perked up. "Could I?"

"Unlikely."

Her shoulders drooped again.

"…Learn to throw the imperious curse, so that you don't feel uncomfortable having it cast on you…"

Her mouth made a small o.

"…Which requires someone to repeatedly cast the imperious curse on you so you can learn to throw it…"

Her mouth snapped shut. Well that was useless.

"…Buy several dozen library trunks, transfer the Black Library to them, and then hide them somewhere, maybe even somewhere as simple as your bedroom…"

"I don't have the gold to do that."

"…I do. But I'm not dumping tens of thousands of galleons just because you're a bit squeamish about the imperious…"

She pouted.

"…I'm not even sure if the family that makes expandable trunks even has that many for sale, or would agree to make that many to order…"

She frowned.

"…We could also full out assault Grimmauld Place, tear down the wards with brute force, and I'll cast the charm in person…"

She shook her head violently.

"…I'm smiling again…"

She scowled. "I know, I can hear it."

Slytherin sighed dramatically "…The other option is to put up some kind of defence that isn't the fidelius charm, but that has exactly the same problem as casting the fidelius does…"

Alex stared at Slytherin's unmoving mask for a few more moments before dropping her head. "So, no other methods then?"

"Well, I did tell you the best… one… first…" Slytherin stalled. "Oh."

"What?"

Slytherin laughed, a deep dark laugh. "Oh, I'm being dumb."

Alex looked up at Slytherin in surprise. "What?"

"Wait just a moment."

They waited.

Then, suddenly, the trunk lid popped open and Luna stuck her head in. "You called, my lord?"

"Luna, do you mind me casting the imperious curse on you?"

Luna beamed. "Nope!"

Slytherin grunted. "Problem solved."</pre>

<pre>The clock wall ticked a few minutes before curfew and his mind stirred from his all-day tired drudge. History of Magic and astronomy were both certified sleepy times. Charms and transfiguration were a bit more risky to catch a kip in, but he hadn't been caught yet. Potions and herbology, on the other hand, gave no chance whatsoever for nap time. They were both group based. As for defence against the dark arts… well, he'd sooner kiss the headmaster than fall asleep in a room containing Hermione, Daphne, and Dark Lord Voldemort.</pre>

<pre>The hard-core pure-blood-supremacist duelling captain chose that moment to stand and storm off to the Slytherin dungeons, followed closely by several other students.

He watched the boys departure sadly and picked up his goblet. He swirled the orange liquid inside. At least this situation would probably weaken the Gray faction somewhat. The attitudes of some of the parents would mirror that of their children. The Gray had been a roadblock to so much of James and Lily's good work for a long time now.

He stilled. Letting the pumpkin juice in his goblet settle down in his hand.

Would it be good though?

What would happen if the Gray fell?

He looked out over Slytherin table, over Gray and Dark mingling and debating, throwing accusations and counter accusations. How many of those in the Gray would come to the Light if the Gray fell?

He did the math in his head.

He flinched. His stomach turned over.

Oh, Merlin. He slammed his goblet down on the table. He needed them, didn't he? He needed a stable Gray, and, by extension, he needed Lord Slytherin.

Fuck.</pre>

<pre>Luna's voice changed back to dreamy. "And I've also been asked to call you all into the living room." Her eyes shone. "I think I saw pudding next to the presents."

— DP & SW: RiBSR —

Alex stared.

There was indeed pudding next to the presents. It was pink, in a large bowl, and had whipped cream on top. Some kind of animated marzipan two-legged lizard with massive teeth stomped around the edge of the bowl. A little sign next to it declared it 'Luna's Pudding'. Runes adorned the side of the bowl. It was a monument to the human sweet tooth, and as such taunted her with its mere existence.

Her father hovered nervously nearby. "Lord Lovegood made it clear that this pudding qualified as a politically sensitive issue, and that the Gray would hate to see anything untoward happen to it."

Luna landed in the chair in front of the bowl, and picked up a large spoon.

John watched Luna from the other side of the table, his face hard and calculating.

Susan, Madam Bones, and Lord and Lady Potter looked bemused.

"What are the runes for?" She asked.

Her father glanced at her. "Blood wards." He coughed. "Only a Lovegood as recognized by the Albion Family Magics can reach the pudding."

Luna spooned up a spoonful of pudding, and spooned it into her mouth. She glowed.

John looked up. "But this house is warded, isn't it? You can have exclusionary wards inside another ward scheme?"

Lily Potter looked shocked but delighted by the question.</pre>

<pre>The two witches edged towards each other. The dodges became closer, the misses nearer, neither willing to back off.

Luna lunged. Two shields appeared from her hands, leaving her no attack.

Ginny's eyes widened at the sudden advance.

His eyes narrowed.

Ginny poured stinging hexes into the shields as the blonde drew closer.

The shields held, power constantly flowing into them. Luna stood right in front of Ginny, full-shield versus full-assault, neither gaining ground on the other.

Then Luna shouted, "Stu-Pi-"—Her mouth glowed red—"-Fy!" A tiny, red light shot from the tip of her tongue, straight into Ginny's stomach.

The redhead blanked. Then collapsed into the soft grass.

He blinked.

He blinked again.

"Luna. Did you just fire a stunner from your tongue?"

"Yesh, Hawwy," Luna said, holding her tongue with her fingers.

He stood up, and walked towards Ginny. "That's just… wow. How did you think to do that?"

"It's long and pointy, Harry. You said that's why we use our fingers. I bet boys can cast from their special boy parts too."

He coughed, and lowered his wand from where he'd been about to enervate Ginny. "I wasn't planning on going into battle naked."

"Oh, Poo."

He shook his head, and turned back towards Ginny. Sometimes Luna freaked him out with how disturbingly adult her thinking could be.

"Enervate."

Ginny stirred, and pushed herself into a sitting position. "What happened?"

"Luna got you with a stunner that she shot from her mouth."

Ginny's jaw dropped. "Wha—?"

"Yeah, I know." He looked back to Luna who was demonstrating by holding her tongue with her fingers, and pointing to it while making 'Ahhhh' noises. "I'd really like to know how that mind works."

"I just want to beat her. Just once!" Ginny pouted.

He shook his head. Despite coming close many times, Luna always managed to stay just one step ahead of Ginny.</pre>

<pre>"Hmm." Said Miss. Night as I starred at the dazzling women as she looked at a red dress that was made of the finest silk. She stood in front of a large triple mirror as she held the dress in front of her and twisted and turned. I however was stuck on a bench about 10 feet away with half my inventory completely full of all shirts, pants, undergarments, shoes, assortments of bags, hats, and just about every clothing option available.

"Hmm." She said again and pulled at the end of dress to and moved a few more times.

"How long have I been here?" I asked myself as Miss. Night shot me a look.

"We bought your things so don't complain." She said as I sighed.

"That only 10 minutes you have been looking at that dress alone for 10 minutes." I said as she glared at me and then turned back at the dress.

"But I like it." She said as I looked over at her.

"Then buy it." I said in a deadpanned voice.

"But it's expensive." She said.

"Then don't buy it." I said back to her.

"But I like it." She said looking at the dress more as I felt like I was in a circle of decisions at the moment.

"How about I buy it?" I asked her as she looked over at me with curious face.

"You? Buy me a dress?" She asked me as I sighed.

"Anything that will get me out of this store." I said back to her.

"You have no patience whatsoever." She said.</pre>

"Who?"

"You Know Who"

"I don't know who. Who?"

"No you bloody idiot. The dark wizard. You know Who!"

"That You Know Who!?"

"Exactly! Some are saying that he's back or something. They're not saying it publicly, or to anyone that matter, but they're saying it."

"You believe them?"

"Not really. I reckon it's some foreign wizard or something who's trying to do some good. But you know how times are. You never know what to believe. There've always been people who've believed that You Know Who isn't really dead. Only . . . gone for now. Its all pretty confusing."

The moment the scrawny boy put on the hat, the hat's expression seemed to become scrunched up and angry. After a couple of minutes of what sounded like quiet grumbling, the hat finally decided that it had had enough of whatever was happening, and yelled out, "NO! I said I will not put you in Ravenclaw Mr. Creevey! GRYFFINDOR! Now get out from under my brim!

"Well you can suck on me nards you wrinkly old sock." Creevey angrily shot back at the hat before he ripped it off his head and handed it to McGonagall, and stomped off to the Gryffindor table.

"Mr. Creevey! Language!" McGonagall snapped.</pre>

<pre>Hermione Granger had never run so fast before. She'd never had a good enough reason to.

And now she did.

Dashing through the corridors, she ducked along to the pathways to the dungeons. She was about take a turn to get to the path towards the Potions Professor's office when suddenly a sound rippled through the corridor from in front of her.

"YRROOWWWRR"

It was Filch's cat.

Hermione felt conflicted for a second before sense of urgency won over her respect of authority. And she decided that she wasn't far gone enough to consider a cat an authority.

The cat that was looking around the corridor received a prompt kick to her behind, sending her flying into a nearby classrom, the door to which Hermione promptly locked from the outside using a deftly performed Colloportus.

Then she ran as fast as she could until she reached the familiar door to Professor Snape's office.

BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!

She kept banging on the door as loud as she could. Her efforts were rewarded when suddenly the door slammed open and the greasy haired Potions Master appeared with an enraged frown on his face.

"MISS GRANGER! What in the name of Merlin are you doing? You just almost completely spoiled a potion that took over six months to brew! What were you th-"

"Quirrell's gone after the Stone Professor!"

Snape's angry tirade halted to a standstill, and he seemed positively thrown off for a second. Hermione rushed to add all she knew about the entire situation before she ended up losing points.

"And Harry's gone after him!"

"WHAT!" the Professor's expression seemed to be oscillating between rage and shock.</pre>

<pre>Professor McGonagall shuffled papers around on her desk. She looked over at her clock, sighed, and took her glasses off to rub her eyes. Why was she still up?

Putting her glasses back on, McGonagall muttered a spell and a stack of papers burst into flames. The past hour of her life was ablaze. One day she would snap and seriously hurt Moody for his paranoia.

"There's no way you can win this argument, James!"

McGonagall groaned. It was too late for this! Maybe if she just turned off the lights, they would simply pass by.

"Lily, honestly, your thinking needs to be set straight!"

"Your thinking needs to be set straight! I can't believe you believe what you do!"

It was too late to put plan into action. By now James and Lily had already seen the light coming from under their professor's door. Sure enough, someone was pounding on the office entrance a moment later.

McGonagall hauled herself out of her chair and made her way over to the door. "Might I ask why you are not in your respective dormitories?" she asked as she opened the door.

"Professor, this is a serious problem!" James stated.

"Is it?" McGonagall questioned, raising an eyebrow.

"This is a make or break relationship question!"

McGonagall raised her other eyebrow.

"He's crazy, Professor!" Lily exclaimed, glaring at James.

"I thought you were already well aware of that fact, Miss Evans," the professor said dryly.

"Alright, the question!" James said. "Which is better: a pirate or a ninja?"

Professor McGonagall did not say anything for a moment. "There'd better be another question, Potter, or you'd better be on your way."

"In that case, we do have another question!" James said brightly.

"We do?" Lily queried.

"Indeed!" James answered. "Do you know if Professor Dumbledore is still up?"

"As a matter of fact, Mr. Potter, I am still awake, though I question why you are," said a familiar voice.

"Professor!" James said happily. "We're still up because we're having a bit of a spat that needs to be cleared up. How about you? Insomnia?"

"James!" Lily hissed.

"Quite alright, Miss Evans!" Dumbledore said with a chuckle. "I've just been sent an owl by a friend of mine, Dorcas Meadows. You may have heard of her before." Dumbledore peered at James over his glasses, making the teenager feel as if Dumbledore knew why James knew. "Now what is the cause of this 'spat' you're having?"

"Well Lily here… ugh! I can't even say it!" James huffed dramatically and looked over at the red-head beside him.

"James has the audacity to say ninjas are better than pirates, Professor!" Lily said with venom.

"Oh, my, Mr. Potter!" Dumbledore said with a disappointed tone. "The skills of a pirate far outweigh those of a ninja."

"You are joking, aren't you, Dumbledore?" asked McGonagall.

"I am not, Minerva!"

"What can a pirate do in comparison to a ninja?"

"I like the way you think, Professor McGonagall!" James said approvingly.

"Professor Dumbledore agrees with me, James. Therefore, I win!" Lily said haughtily.

"No offence, to you, Headmaster," James said, "but between you and our Transfiguration Professor, my money's on her!"

Lily gasped in horror and outrage. Dumbledore sighed. "I'm afraid, Mr. Potter, that you're quite delusional. I believe a note to your parents is in order."

"Oh, now see here, Dumbledore," McGonagall butted in, "Potter's welcome to have his own opinion!"

"Since when has Hogwarts been a democracy?" Dumbledore asked.

James threw a fist into the air. "Fight the power!" he exclaimed.

"Doing as the higher power tells you usually ends better," Lily snapped.

"Arguable!" said a new voice. Sirius came around the corner and stood by his best friend.

"Why must you always pop into these conversations, Black? I thought you were stalking Dennis? Get lost!" Lily snarled.

"Dennis?" Sirius asked. "He's right over there! OY! DENNIS! GET OVER HERE!"

"You've lost, Lily. Ninjas now outvote the pirates," James said smugly.

"Is that so?" Lily asked. "Dennis!" she said warmly to the second year coming around the corner, "Ninjas or pirates?"

"Pirates!" Dennis said without hesitation.

"Good lad!" Dumbledore said with pride.

"Detention, Stingfellow!" McGonagall said, glaring at him.

"Hold on, Professor," James said in a calm voice. "Padfoot and I have got this one."

"We most certainly do, Prongs," Sirius said mildly. "Dennis, come here."

"You'll never catch me, a pirate!" Dennis proclaimed. "I'm a pro at escaping the law! I wish you luck!" As James and Sirius slowly stepped toward him, Dennis flung open a portrait on the wall and shut it behind himself.

"That one goes to the seventh floor, Padfoot!" James exclaimed. "Go! Go! Go!"

"Wait! Prongs! It can also go down to the kitchens!" Sirius argued.

"Where do you think I'm going?" James asked as he ran around a corner.

Lily found herself feeling very awkward alone in a hallway with the Headmaster and his Deputy.

"Miss Evans," McGonagall said with a sigh, "I'm very disappointed in you." She went back into her office and closed the door.

"Don't listen to her," Dumbledore said after a moment, "She gets rather moody after losing an argument." He winked at his student and walked off, humming to himself.

Lily grinned and skipped all the way back to her room and promptly fell asleep.</pre>

<pre>"Now please sit still while I go find a book on magical transportation."

After a few minutes in which Harry gleefully conjured and immolated miniature effigies of dragons, Snape, dragons, Malfoy, and dragons, Hermione returned, nose already buried in a thick tome. About three steps from the table, she began reading.

"A Portkey is an object enchanted to instantly bring anyone touching it to a specific location. Portkeys may be triggered either through contact with another object – a person, a gloved hand, a wand – or at a specific time. They can be created to last for multiple or only one use, and may or may not return to the original destination upon a secondary activation. The incantation to create a portkey is portus."

"Hmm, I think I see. So I can create a portkey to the egg, and then-"

"Honestly, Harry. That's stupid and reckless. Just like all of your plans. No, here's what you do…"

After a few minutes of conferring, Harry felt much better about the upcoming first task. There was, however, still research to be carried out.

"Hermione, I need a phonebook!"

"And now, last but definitely not least, our final contestant – Harry James Potter!" Ludo Bagman was in his element commentating. "And here he is, our very own Boy-Who-Lived! I believe we are in for a spectacular display of magic!"

With a determined stride and a wave at Hermione, Harry walked towards the dragon.

"Our young hero is pointing his wand at the dragon's chain – what does he intend to do? I believe he's about to-"

Harry shouted portus, resulting in the instantaneous disappearance of the dragon.

"Well, that was unexpected." After a few minutes of staring, Bagman had regained his composure. "Is he… can he even do that?!"

Albus Dumbledore leaned in and whispered something in Bagman's ear.

"For those curious I have just been informed that the dragon has reappeared in a secret dungeon containing an enormous potions lab under a small cottage in Spinner's End, Cokeworth."

With a loud crash and an even louder yell, Severus Snape fell out of his seat.

+

"It looks like our youngest contestant is finally ready to cast a spell! We might even see a bit of excitement here today – staring at a lake for an hour gets a bit boring. I believe he is trying to- What in the name of Merlin? Did he just turn the Black Lake into a selective portkey, taking everybody but Ms. Granger?"

Harry calmly mounted his broom and flew towards the middle of the former lake.

"Well… We might as well just declare him the winner. For those interested, I have just been informed that the lake – and all its inhabitants, including the other champions – has reappeared in a secret dungeon containing an enormous potions lab under a small cottage in Spinner's End, Cokeworth."

Once again, Severus Snape had an accident with his chair.

+

"Harry James Potter, please tell me you did not turn Voldemort into an experimental portkey to space?!"

Pretending complete ignorance of the impending explosion, Harry gave a winning smile. "And the best part is that if he tries to apparate back to earth, he will instantly activate the portkey the moment he contacts the atmosphere. Of course, it is likely that he will die from space exposure before he even has the chance to attempt an apparition. In that case he will be stranded in wraith form 4.3 lightyears from earth, giving us somewhere around twenty million years to prepare…"

Hermione huffed. "Honestly, Harry. That was dangerous. What if he had transported the entire planet there? You don't know nearly enough about portkey travel to attempt an experiment like that. And to make matters worse, you didn't work on the essay, potentially costing Gryffindor points! If you hadn't promised me ice cream…"

When Hermione came down to breakfast and noticed the completely empty Slytherin hourglass, she knew something was up. After one look at Gryffindor table, she deduced the cause.

"Harry, I know that look. What stupid thing have you done this time?"

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Stop trying to look innocent and tell me!"

"…"

"Harry James Potter!"

"Well… I may have turned Malfoy's favorite bottle of shampoo into a portkey…"

A severely subdued Draco Malfoy arrived in the great hall, glancing nervously between the Slytherin table and the staff table, where a furious McGonagall was staring at him, muttering something about bed sheets having to be changed. As he sat down between Crabbe and Goyle, he could be heard whispering: "My father will never hear about this…"

"Honestly, Harry!"</pre>

<pre>Five minutes later, Fleur and Tonks were both quite annoyed. The recalcitrant potion was being very uncooperative and simply refused to vanish. Spells didn't work, spooning it out didn't work, soaking it up didn't work…they'd even tried to tip the cauldron and the potion and Horcrux stayed firmly inside.

"Zis is stupid. What type of potion can be spelled to require someone drink it?" Fleur huffed glaring at the solution.

Tonks threw up her hands. "Screw it. Let's just conjure a donkey or something. Then we can feed Voldemort's potion to an ass."

Fleur shook her head in exasperation. "Zat pun works better in ze United States, mon amour. Let us hope zat Voldemort's potion has a sense of humor zough." Fleur raised her wand and quickly transfigured one of the nearby rocks into a small goat. It seemed real enough…whether the ephemeral nature of the thing would fool the potion though…

"No donkey?" Tonks asked raising her eyebrows.

Fleur winced. "Donkeys…zey don't like me. A goat will have to do."

"Babe, it's a transfiguration, it does what you want for the most part…"

"But zis way we can make fun of ze Old Goat, no?" Fleur said conjuring a pair of glasses and plopping them onto the goat's head along with a large purple wizard's hat. "Doesn't he look like Dumbledore now?"

Tonks snorted in amusement shaking her head at her partner's misdirection though appreciating the irony inherent in using a Dumbledore Goat to try and retrieve a Horcrux. She reached down with the provided ladle and with Fleur's assistance fed the first spoonful to the goat. Nearly immediately, the poor thing dropped to the ground completely paralyzed. Tonks cringed. "I know it's not technically alive but this still sucks; despite the fact that the paralyzing thing is somewhat hilarious. Goats are weird. At least it's not screaming."

Fleur nodded and held the goat's mouth open as Tonks poured a second mouthful into it. Tonks had gone back for another scoop when the goat stopped playing dead and decided to start screaming instead. Tonks winced and glared slightly at Fleur. "See, told you we'd be cursed if we finished fate-tempting thoughts. I never should have said that…Hold the bloody ass still."</pre>

<pre>Less than fifteen minutes into the train ride, a head appeared in the doorway, which lit up when he spotted the occupants. It was Ron.

"Do you mind if I join you?" He asked, hauling his trunk into the compartment, without waiting for an answer. "All the other compartments are full."

"No, they're not." Harry and Hermione replied in unison.

Ron's eartips were instantly red. "Yeah, they are."

Harry stood, moved out of the door and peered in the next compartment... which was empty. "That one's empty." He said as he came back into the compartment. "Here, I'll help you move your trunk." Not even giving Ron time to think, he started lugging the trunk into the next compartment. Ron, however, woke up.

"Wait!" He began tugging on his trunk, stopping Harry from simply walking away with it. "Can't I join you?"

"You came in here and said all the other compartments are full." Hermione pointed out reasonably. "That means that you were looking for an empty compartment. There's one right there, so we'll help you into that one."

"Well... I'd rather sit with people." Ron said. "And besides, he's Harry Potter..."

"I know." Hermione said. "So what?"

Ron turned to Harry, and asked the inevitable question. "Have you got... you know... the scar?"

"Yes." Harry said coldly.

"Can I see it?"

"No."

Ron pouted. "Why not?"

"Because I don't like showing my facial disfigurement off to people." Harry replied. "That's why I have a long fringe. And you're being very rude... whoever you are."

Dropping his trunk, Ron held out his hand. "I'm Ron. Ron Weasley."

"Charmed." Hermione drawled.

"Well... nice to meet you, Ron." Harry said, taking the now-free trunk and pulling it into the corridor. "Your compartment awaits, sir. Please, feel free to leave us alone."

Ron was looking nervous as Hermione pushed him into the corridor, holding him at bay until Harry could return to the compartment and shut the door, locking Ron out. He tugged on the door for a moment, before his shoulders slumped and he headed into the empty compartment.

+

"P-Potter..." It wheezed, "I refuse... to die... I... I am... im... immortal..."

"You were." Harry corrected. "Your soul anchors have been destroyed, your powers broken. I have finished the job I started nine years ago. Your time has ended, Tom. Go on to your next adventure..." He sighed slightly. "I wash my hands of your filth forever."

The cloud flashed for a moment, before dissipating entirely.

"That's how it ends." Harry whispered. "Not with a bang, but with a whimper..."

Hermione came over to her husband, one hand tucked behind her back. "It's over, Harry. You did it."

"It's not over, Miss..." Dumbledore trailed off as he scanned his prodigious memory. "Miss Granger."

"Mrs. Potter." Hermione corrected.

"No, I don't think so. You're too young to be married, and as Mr. Potter is my magical dependant, I have not given my permission for him to wed." He straightened up. "I've had enough of this foolishness. I declare whatever marriage you think you have to be null and void. As for Hogwarts, unless the Board of Governors removes me from my position, I am still the Headmaster."

Hermione shook her head. "Nope. The Heirs of Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Gryffindor have removed you, and the goblins will be executing you tonight. You've lost, Dumbledore. You gambled and lost."

Dumbledore shook his head. "I refuse to accept that. As long as there is Darkness in the world, there will be a Dumbledore to-"

"Promote it?" Hermione asked, stepping forward, dangling a rat from her left hand. "Like you allowed a Death Eater to enter Hogwarts... well, another one, anyway."

McGonagall blinked. "That's a rat." She said pointlessly.

"No, it's not." Harry and Hermione replied together. "This is, in fact, a Death Eater named Peter Pettigrew."</pre>

<pre>Harry Potter was drunk. Not just drunk, but drunk.

As usual, the gang had gathered at Wet Wands for an evening of drinking, eating and general debauchery. The date, Halloween, was no coincidence.

It was widely accepted among his circle of friends that Harry only drank on four occasions during each year; a small glass of FireWhiskey to 'bring in the new year', a single champagne toast on Hermione's birthday (which made each and every one of his friends roll their eyes at his utter thickness), another small FireWhiskey on June 26th, the anniversary of his godfather's death, but on Halloween, he got wankered. Completely. Utterly.

As such, being good and loyal friends, the semi-small group made sure that Harry wasn't alone on Halloween. In '98, after He-Who-Now-Fertilises-The-Pumpkin-Patch had been defeated, Harry had stayed alone at Grimmauld Place, telling his friends he wanted a night of quiet introspection, and sealing up the house to insure his privacy.</pre>

<pre>He should turn his back on them and say that he didn't want their cheers and admiration. After all, weren't they – this faceless mass of people – to blame for the prejudice against muggleborns that fostered Voldemort's rise to power? Weren't they to blame for the fact he was under an indenture?

But, the truth was he wanted their love and respect. And, wasn't it unfair to judge them too harshly? Was it their fault that, at their deepest nature, people were not to be trusted? How could he demand of them what they could never give him?</pre>

<pre>At that moment, Snape and Malfoy walked out of the Astronomy Tower, completely unaware of the situation below. Harry frowned when both Snape and Malfoy were walking freely and each had his wand in his own hand, Malfoy following Snape.

The two were surprised to find the fight over and they were on the losing side. Malfoy panicked and brought his wand up. "Avada-"

Harry knew exactly what he had to do.

"-Kedavra!" As Malfoy said the last word, his arm suddenly moved left with the help of a very small band of air around his wrist. Instead of the spell streaking for McGonagall, the spell only went about one wand-length and hit Snape in the side and back. With a look of surprise, Snape crumpled to the floor. Malfoy just blinked and stared at his wand.</pre>

<pre>Harry took a breath, he wasn't convinced about Bones yet. She seemed to have a little too much pride in herself and unwilling to admit she was wrong. Just not as badly as Fudge.

"Professor Umbridge has been using torture on me." He stated as he held out his hand. Fleur had made a cut on his other hand to show him how to heal it but had insisted he not heal the words until seen by a member of Law Enforcement. They had already sent pictures to the ICW.

Bones flinched. "And just how is she supposed to have done this?"

"With a special quill. She made me write in my own blood."

"And you have proof?"

"Beyond my scars and my willing testimony under veritiserum? No."

"For Merlin's sake Amelia! Why are you being so obtuse?" McGonagall demanded. "Get the boy his ICW advocate and his veritiserum! In the meantime we should search the Professor's office for these blasted quills!"

"I do not have the authority to go rummaging through the Under-Secretaries belongings, Minerva!" She countered heatedly.

"Would you like to see my memories?" Harry asked quietly.

"What?" Bones asked, nonplussed.

"My memories. Professor Dumbledore has a pensieve."

"Indeed, you are welcome to avail yourself of it." Dumbledore spoke up for the first time in the meeting. Harry was not pleased with the man. He had refused to look at him throughout the entire conversation and acted as though he wasn't there.

After a quick tutorial, Madam Bones descended into the memory.

She returned a few minutes later looking very pale.

"That was not your detention."

Harry was a picture of innocence. "Oh, did I use the wrong memory?"

"You know damned well what memory that was."

"And is there a problem with me showing you that memory?" Harry countered, his tone hard. "Or would you rather not know the truth that Fudge and Umbridge are trying to cover up?"

Harry scooped out the memory and replaced it with the detention. "That's the proper memory, I promise."

"Merlin's Beard! Blood quills!" Bones breathed as she exited the memory.

+

"Master Harry is needing help?"

Harry looked down to see Dobby standing there in eager anticipation. "You're God?"

Dobby looked a little worried. "Dobby is Dobby. Is Master Harry alright?"

"No. Fleur is latched onto me and I can't get her off. I can't even find her bedroom to put her down."

+

Once they were on the plane Andy threatened Sirius with a gag. He just would not shut up about the amazing metal flying broom.

"For the love of God, Padfoot!" Harry exclaimed eventually. "Shut up! There is no way Mum didn't tell you about planes."

"Listen you!" Sirius glared at him across the aisle. "Every year we magical born have to put up with excitable ten and eleven-year-olds gasping and exclaiming all down Diagon Alley. You can give a magical born a break when they first encounter something like a giant metal broomstick!"

"At least muggle-raised learn the right terms." Harry sneered. "No wonder Fleur can beat you at Scrabble in English."

"Christ on a bike! You're joking?" Andy leaned forward from the seat behind Sirius.

"She cheats!"

"Easy way to prove it." Harry shrugged.

"We don't have a Scrabble board." Sirius sneered.

"All we need is a book and some paper and pens."

And so it came to pass that the for the first time in decades the French and British battled each other over the English Channel.

Harry sat there with a manual for the microwave in the staff kitchen and called out words for them to spell.

An English rebellion was soon in the making as Andy became more and more disgusted with Sirius' pitiable literacy skills.

By the time they landed in Lyon, Andy was threatening the former prisoner with new accommodations in the Tower of London. Sirius was an abysmal specimen of an educated Englishman.

Harry pointed out that he was actually a prime example of an English wizard.

+

Back in the south, the Ministry was also in a tizzy. Fudge had people running around and banging on doors on everywhere from the Department of Muggle Relations to the Department of Mysteries. He was desperate to find out if Potter's threat applied to him.

"Cornelius, I fail to see the issue." Lucius chided his puppet smoothly. "Even if you do consider yourself in debt to Potter, he has wasted it on this horrible fantasy that the Dark Lord has returned. We both know that to be false, so in effect, he has released you from that oath."

"But what if he was right and Lord-Thingy is back!?"

Lucius cringed at the awful name the current Minister used for his master. It what was made worse by the fact that Fudge was not trying to be brave… he was just an imbecile.

"If the Dark Lord was back, then surely he would have made sure the entire world knew." Lucius reasoned.

"Yes… yes, of course. Thank you my friend." Fudge wiped his sweaty brow with a handkerchief. He gave a forced laugh. "Imagine if the brat was telling the truth! Half the country would lose their magic if they did nothing."

Lucius cringed again. That 'half' would consist of half-bloods and purebloods. Most of the muggleborn weren't even born. With muggleborn running things they would likely involve the muggles themselves. There had been one undocumented raid that only the Dark Lord's inner circle knew of. It involved an RAF base and the loss of over fifty wizards whilst the muggles emerged unscathed.

The Dark Lord had immediately ordered that they avoid the muggle military and law enforcement.</pre>

<pre>"Those are the important staff changes. Now, the real changes: non-magical courses are now mandatory. Less time has been allotted for magical courses. To make sure that you are getting your magical practise, you are allowed to use magic anywhere in the school for practical reasons.

"For instance. Fifth through seventh years, you will notice from now on that you will no longer be provided with a knife and fork. You will need to conjure your own.

"Second through fourth years are provided a simple block of wood that you will need to transfigure.

"First years, you aren't expected to worry about anything like that, but you must study and practise if you want to eat with cutlery after your first year."

The new batch of midgets looked greatly relieved.</pre>

"HARRY JAMES POTTER! What the devil do you think you are doing?" Hermione demanded as she stomped up and started to tend to Fleur's broken and bleeding nose.

"She slapped me." Harry shrugged as he rubbed his red face.

"And you decided to retaliate by punching her in the face?" Hermione sneered.

"If you can't take it, don't dish it out." Dudley, who had just come up behind them, commented. "Now why would Fleur attack Harry? Is she under one of those mind control curses?"

"No idea, but I doubt it." Harry answered.</pre>

<pre>Yoshiko had a near evil grin when Harry ordered Severus to get out of the castle and resolve his situation with the Kitsune. Harry had been careful to suggest that Severus tell Yoshiko the truth about his status.

Nicholas was pretty pissed though. Severus being gone meant they needed a new Potions Professor to stand in. Albus didn't have the time with the tournament in full swing so the Immortal Alchemist found himself drafted.

It was even more annoying as Harry didn't attend classes so he couldn't get his revenge there.

He did, however, over hear a few of 'Harry's Girls' (as they called themselves) talking about something that gave him an idea.

A mean idea.

An idea so evil that Perenelle actually caught him cackling over a cauldron.

Unfortunately for Harry, Penny actually liked the idea and so they both ended up cackling over the cauldron.</pre>

<pre>Harry had had a very busy summer. It was filled with tasks that were nigh on impossible. From negotiating with goblins to avoiding the wrath of Aurora Sinastra.

But now he had to deal with his greatest and most difficult mission of the summer.

"I absolutely refuse to do this willingly."

Harry sighed as he looked up at the black clad and scowling Severus Snape. "I don't want to order you to do this Sev. But you need to do this."

They were currently standing on a muggle street in Peckham, London.

"I have survived more than thirty years. I can survive thirty more." Severus said firmly.

"Yeah, and I'm not supposed to be able to live while Tom 'survives' and vice versa. You deserve better. I take my responsibilities seriously. Regardless of why you are my slave, you are still a sentient being, muggles have laws about how even their worst criminals are to be treated with a modicum of dignity."

"Does this mean you are going to release me?" Severus asked sarcastically.

"You're still serving your time. Ask me again in say…seven to nine years." Harry smirked. He couldn't actually release Severus, but he could give him permission to live as though he were free.

Severus looked at him with a confused frown. "You'd really release me?"

"Sev, you can't lie to me." Harry sighed. "I'll know when you are ready to be free. When you've let go of your anger and hate and learnt to actually enjoy life, then you'll be ready."

"And in the mean time you take pleasure in subjecting me to these… tortures." He spat.

"You are such a goddamned baby. Get in there!" Harry barked.

Around them, the various passers-by and shoppers chuckled as they watched a thirteen-year-old boy order a very dour thirty-year-old into a muggle barbershop named 'Desmond's'.

Two seconds later an older black man with a scraggly beard, rumpled clothing and a distinctive hat ran screaming from the small shop.

Inside the shop Harry turned and glared at a rather smug Severus. "That is why you are getting an image fix."

"Ignore Porkpie." A thin, older black man said dismissively. "He'd jump at his own reflection. What can we do for you here at Desmond's?"

The man had a strong Caribbean accent.

"There is an old African saying-"

"Not now Matthew!" The older man snapped at a young black man sitting on the waiting chairs behind the barber's chairs.

"Matthew, why don't you go and see if Porkpie has stopped running and make sure he hasn't had a heart attack." A woman instructed.

"Fine, but I'm not going to the hospital with him. I have class this afternoon." The man was dressed like a student.

Eventually it was just Harry, Severus, the man and the woman in the shop.

"So, I am Shirley and this is my husband, Desmond." Shirley introduced them with a smile. "What would you like?"

"Sev here needs a haircut." Harry said bluntly.

"A haircut? Looks like he's gonna need a whole lot more than just a haircut." Desmond said as he eyed the scowling man warily. "Is that… oil in your hair, boy?"

"The name- oof" Severus glared down at the thirteen year old with the wandering elbows.

"Sev works as a chemist and… he spends too much time with the fumes." Harry explained.

"Shirl', you better take him first. Get him cleaned and then we can talk styles." Desmond instructed his wife.

"I'll just take a seat." Harry went to sit down.

"Oh no you don't young man." Desmond quickly grabbed him by the shoulders and ushered him into the barber's chair. "You look like you could use a trim for that mop top you got going. You also look like you're becoming a man! Need to start shaving now." Desmond said proudly. "I'll treat you to your very first shave whilst my wife deals with your friend."

Harry was pretty pleased with that news. He was finally getting the rest of his hair.

+

For once in their time as companions, Harry had actually asked Ember to take him to see Albus.

"Albie… you're flaming."

"Harry, that is not appr- oh- oh my!" Albus began patting his beard as he noticed the flames Harry was indicating.

He was hit in the face with a blast of water and began spluttering.

When he caught his breath he sent a withering glare at his student. "I had it under control." He said tetchily.

"Fire retardant charm?" Harry asked.

"Excuse me?"

"You used a fire retardant charm."

"Ah… I suppose that would have been prudent." Albus admitted somewhat chagrined as he looked down at the glass containing the flaming topped beverage that had been the culprit of his Flaming Facial.

"Moron." Harry muttered as he sat down at the table in what appeared to be a restaurant, the other patrons were laughing at the spectacle. "So, where are we now?"

"New Zealand. Can I interest you in a Kiwi Cup?" Albus had a small smirk as he indicated the fiery beverage.

"I'll pass." Harry would never understand wiggles and their ridiculous obsession with things that could kill them.

He ignored the fact that he was attempting to travel to the moon.

"I've got another problem with a student, but this is a little more serious than helping with the Three R's."

"Three R's?"

"Reading, Writing and Arithmetic."

Albus frowned. "Arithmetic starts with an 'a'."

"Considering the wiggle world doesn't teach any of them as a matter of basics, I don't think you get to comment." Harry said blandly.

Albus sighed. "Must you continue to use that word?"

"I'll stop saying 'wiggle' when wiggles stop saying muggle." Harry grinned.</pre>

<pre>Albus was disgusted at having to preside over this despicable event. There had only been one other duel of this magnitude. It had occurred when he had called Gellert out during the war.

Although he had defeated his former love interest and ended his reign of terror, he had failed to officially end the duel by not killing him. It was a stain on both men's honour, but he had made the challenge out of ear shot of anyone. His final spell had been a memory charm that removed Gellert's memory of it being a duel to the death.

As such, magic would not accept any claim he had over the Grindlewald House. Only his brother knew the truth. Aberforth hated him for it because it meant that he could not marry or have children. The Houses of Dumbledore and Grindlewald were in limbo until the duel was ended.</pre>

<pre>"Every Obliviator needs to present the required authorisation papers to the wizard or witch being Obliviated." Filius groaned. He was kicking himself for not thinking of that himself.

Harry was just grasping at straws, he had no idea that there was required paperwork; he just wanted to keep the argument going till he could get Fudge out of the school.

"Well, Cornelius? We wouldn't want to breach Ministry Laws now, would we?" Albus asked with a slight smugness.

"I believe my presence is authority enough!" Fudge puffed up pompously.

"I don't." Harry retorted. "Get out before the castle kicks you out." He ordered.

+

"Everybody! Your attention please!" Filius called out as he climbed on the staff table so he could be seen. "In order to prevent a repeat of today's little fiasco with the Obliviators, I am advising all of you to write to your parents immediately after the meal. Tell them about Minister Fudge's actions and the Obliviators and also tell them about why they were here: To erase any knowledge of Mister Draco Malfoy's actions as a thief.

"If your parents know then they can file a complaint and tell others, this will make having your memories erased, pointless."

Harry, who was still standing gave a pointed look at Hermione. Hopefully she would see the half-goblin as a much better role-model.

The Obliviators were not seen again. This may have had something to do with the Daily Prophet's headline the next morning:

'MINISTER FUDGE LEADS OBLIVIATORS IN ATTACK ON OUR CHILDREN!'

It was safe to assume that Fudge had his hands full with other matters.

+

"Where's Fudge?" Harry asked.

All eyes turned to the staff table. Very cautiously, the Minister raised his head from his position hiding behind the Headmaster's throne like chair.

"Is he gone?"

Dumbledore at his patronizing best addressed the Minister. "Yes, Cornelius, Lord Voldemort-"

"Lord No Name." Harry corrected.

"I beg your pardon?"

"He has lost his titles and holdings to me, hence, he is Lord No Name… or more accurately, Mister No Name." Harry explained.

+

By the end of the following week Harry was called into a meeting with Professor Flitwick.

"Harry, thank you so much for coming." Filius said sincerely.

"Wait… I'm not in trouble?" He asked, he was generally only called to a teacher's office for getting in trouble. In his previous timeline it was by McGonagall.

"Of course not, I… that is to say, we the teachers, need your help."

"You want the armour to help in class?"

"No, we-"

"Want larger classrooms?"

"N- actually we wouldn't say no to that one but that's not why I called you here, we-"

"Want a pay rise… you know I don't actually control that sort of thing?"

"Harry!"

"Sorry."

Filius snorted at the far too innocent look on Harry's face. "I highly doubt it. It's about Miss Granger."

"She seems to be doing well does she-"

"Harry! Don't get going again!" Filius warned.

"Sorry."

"Again, I doubt it. Look, she keeps handing these essays in." He said as he handed over a rolled up piece of parchment.

Harry unfurled it slightly. "I remember this one. What was it… ah yes, two feet on why we can't use the levitation spell on ourselves."

"Open the whole thing." Filius instructed dryly.

Harry released the bottom and raised an eyebrow as six feet of parchment fell to the ground.

"Huh… with this amount I would have thought she had actually found a way to disprove the topic." Harry muttered.

+

"MISTER POTTER! I insist you call off the armour!"

"Look, Dumbledore, you can't have it both ways. If I control the armour then I must be Lord Slytherin. But you keep saying I'm not, so that means I don't control the armour. Make up your mind but do it away from me!" Harry said angrily as he stomped off leaving his unfinished breakfast behind.

+

"Madam Bones and Professor McGonagall are about to be rescued by the armies of Hogwarts." The Hat spoke up.

"Hogwarts has no armies, it's a school!"

"You keep telling yourself that." Harry laughed. He was bluffing at this point. He didn't want to, but he would kill the goblins. He had no idea what the Hat meant by armies of Hogwarts though.

*BOOM*

"There they are now." The Hat said blandly.

*BOOM*

"I imagine it will only take them about twenty minutes to break down the doors."

*BOOM*

*RUFF RUFF RUFF* *AAARRRROOOOGGGG*

"Is that-"

"Fluffy and the troll."

"I'M A COMING HARRY!"

"And Hagrid, apparently."

"So the army of Hogwarts consists of a Cerberus, a troll and a half giant?" Harry asked.

"Not to mention the one hundred and fifty odd suits of armour." The Hat corrected. "And Albus Dumbledore… for all his faults he takes his role as Headmaster seriously."

"Thank Merlin." Minerva breathed.

"Well, what do you think? Gonna start behaving now?" Harry asked.

The goblin growled. "Fine! Put the sword away and we will discuss terms."

"You first. And send someone to open the doors or they will keep banging away!"

"Why should we move first?!"

"Because you still have the home advantage, my army is stuck outside, plus I am the only one on my side willing to kill you.

"And I have a sword at your throat." Harry twisted the blade a little just to put a little point on his argument.

+

Outside the bank Severus Snape was having a very conflicted time. On the one hand he was infuriated that his slave bound body was forced to head to the bank in order to save its new master. On the other hand, he was actually enjoying using some of the most vicious spells he knew to try and break down the doors of the most loathed creatures on the planet just shy of the Dementors.

What made it worse was the proud and approving smile that Dumbledore had given him when his body had opened its mouth and told the aging man that they were there to rescue Potter. He had never wanted to die so badly before in his life.

"THA' DOORS ARE CRACKIN'!" Came the jubilant cry of Hagrid followed by an answering roar of simple enjoyment from the half-giant's pet troll.

Whilst Albus and Severus along with a contingent of Aurors cast all manner of blasting hexes and the like, the suits of armour had brought a battering ram with them. Somewhere deep in the bowels of the castle, the weapons of war still sat. How they got to the bank was still a mystery.

"JUS' A FEW MORE WHACKS!"

*BOOM*

*BOOM*

*BOOM*

*BOOM*

*THUD*

There was a cloud of dust that gradually settled revealing that they hadn't so much as managed to smash the doors open as blast them off their hinges. There was a cheer of triumph from the Aurors, although truth be told, they hadn't been very effective as the doors were warded against magic.

Severus wanted to curse as his traitorous body didn't wait but sprang through the massive doorway. He might have actually succeeded in dying of shame had he seen the beaming smile on Dumbledore's face. The old man truly believed that Severus had grown beyond his petty grudge and had come to care for the son of his late rival.</pre>

<pre>"Harry's future in Quidditch aside we need a plan to deal with the You-Know-Who."

"How about Lord No Name?" Harry piped up.

"I beg your pardon?" Amelia asked.

"Everyone is afraid of his name, but he was beaten by a baby and lost everything. The Hat was telling me about how Draco could be cast out of his house for challenging me because it would be seen as challenging his father and that would make him 'Draco No Name'. So call Voldemort 'Lord No Name'. Seems fitting."

"And quite the slap in the face." Filius giggled.

"And legally binding." Amelia mused. "Anyway, regarding Lord No Name… we need a plan."</pre>

<pre>"Now, I will show you a very unique technique." Harry said seriously. "Animal to human transformations. It is more of a ritual that requires a transfigured bowl and conjured water."

"Mrow?" The cat said with suspicion.

"We take an animal, such as this delightful little kitty, and we bathe it in water, like so."

The cat screeched and leapt out of his arms, transforming into Minerva McGonagall as it landed.

"And there you have it class! A perfect animal to human transformation!" Harry crowed triumphantly.

The class was looking on in awe… except Hermione who was viciously flipping through her textbook looking for the documentation.

"Mister Potter!" Minerva screeched.

"Class, as you can see, the specimen now has all of the speech and mental abilities of a human as though it were that human."

"Potter!" She took a step closer.

"In fact, the specimen has no idea it ever was an animal."

"Sit down Mister Potter!"

"Catnip?" Harry asked innocently as he held up a hand holding the feline addictive substance.

Minerva involuntarily moved forward to sniff his hand.

"As you can see, the specimen retains some of its natural instincts." Harry lectured.

Minerva raised her wand with difficulty and vanished the source of her addiction. "Harry Potter, take your seat now!"

"Does anyone have any questions?" Harry asked as he ignored the fuming teacher. "Pavarti, yes?"

"How do you reverse the process?" She asked curiously.

"Oh for Merlin's sake." The Professor groaned.

"It's difficult, but it can be done." Harry nodded gravely. "Often you need to just wait for the specimen to revert on its own. But otherwise…" He raised his wand quickly and cast a transfiguration that turned the Professor into a cat that largely resembled the Professor's previous feline form.

The cat started to growl at him.

"Erm… that's it for class today." Harry said hastily as the cat backed down into a pouncing position. "Your homework is to be able to complete the book to bowl transfiguration, research animagus or ask Granger about it and finally… ask the Weasley twins about the perils of pranking teachEEERSSS!" Harry practically screamed the last bit as he ran from the room with an angry cat on his tail.

The rest of the class turned to Hermione who started to giggle in realisation.

"What's so funny?" Neville, her table partner asked.

"I think Professor McGonagall is a cat animagus. She can turn herself into a cat. Harry knew this and took over her lesson."

"Why is that funny?"

"Because right now Harry Potter is being chased through the school by a professor in the shape of a cat."

Harry ran to the only place he could think of. The hospital wing.

Madam Pomfrey was shocked as the school's celebrity student came barrelling in before darting behind her.

"Protect me Madam Pomfrey! An evil cat is after me!"

Poppy could see the laughter in the boy's eyes and wondered what was going on.

Her answer arrived in the form of her colleague in cat form.

"Is there a reason you are stalking Mister Potter, Minerva?" She asked as she valiantly tried not to smile.

Valiant though her efforts were… she failed.

The cat began meowing and hissing and growling.

Poppy raised an eyebrow at the fact that Minerva had not transformed to human form. She took out her wand and cast some diagnostic spells.

She then determined the problem and reversed the transfiguration.

"Really Minerva, beaten by a first year?" Poppy chided teasingly.

"That… first year is a menace!" She hissed. "He not only took over my class but he threatened to… bathe me in some fantasy ritual." She said bathe like a curse.

"Minerva! Harry is only eleven, I doubt he has those urges yet." Poppy scowled.

Harry looked a little green as Minerva was outraged.

"As a cat! He was going to bathe me as a cat."

"Perhaps one of you could give me a full accounting of what has occurred? As enjoyable as hearing snippets is, I believe I need the full story."

"The Profess-"

"I will tell the story Mister Potter." Minerva said warningly.

Poppy chuckled as she pulled up a chair and indicated for Harry to sit on a nearby bed. She then listened to Minerva's tale with much enjoyment.

"Do you agree with Professor McGonagall's recounting, Mister Potter?" She asked as Minerva finished.

"She forgot the homework I set, but that's about right."

"Homework?"

"To be able to perform the book to bowl transfiguration by the next lesson, to ask or research animagi and to ask the Weasley Twins about the perils of pranking a teacher." Harry shrugged.

"Harry, did you know the cat was Professor McGonagall at the beginning of the lesson?" She asked shrewdly.

Harry looked sheepish. "Yes'm."

"How many of your fellow students managed to complete the book to bowl transfiguration?"

"None of them. They all managed to make something that will hold water, but only a few had anything near metallic."

Poppy nodded. "Minerva, what were you planning to do to Mister Potter?"

"Aside from getting him to change me back?" She asked with a sarcastic sneer.

"Minerva." Poppy said warningly.

"The boy will be serving detentions, that is for certain."

"Good, then give him some points and make him your assistant in class."

"The boy is a menace worse than his father!"

"Yes, and quite the prodigy." Poppy said calmly. "Personally I think he would give James a run for his money in raw talent. Even if most of his knowledge does come from that blasted scar, he still has the skill to use it. Give him his detentions and make him work on OWL level spells. Maybe if you get him to pass his exams early you can be rid of him."

"Aww… more work?" Harry groaned. "I already had to teach a class today."

"Silence Harry, you brought this on yourself." Poppy chastised, she was enjoying herself far too much.

+

At dinner that evening things became quite awkward when Seamus Finnegan wobbled unsteadily over to the Slytherin table and up to Harry with a ridiculous dopey grin on his face.

"You're a'righ' Po'er." The boy slurred. "You know your stuff… best… day… ever."

Seamus then collapsed in a heap on the floor.

Severus and Minerva quickly rushed over.

"Disgusting. The boy is drunk." Severus sneered.

"Impossible! Where would he get alcohol?" Minerva challenged.

"I blame those reprobate twins of yours." Severus smirked.

"Perhaps Seamus could use a sobering potion?" Harry suggested pointedly to his Head of House.

Of course from Severus' point of view it was more of an order and he merely turned on his heel and left to carry it out.

"Erm, Professor, I think Seamus managed to transfigure the water into rum." Tracey Davis said hesitantly.

"How on Earth would he know how to do that?"

"I don't know Ma'am, but I overheard him talking about it as we were leaving class."

Harry had to bury his face in his hands as he tried not to laugh. Apparently he was so good a teacher that whereas in his previous time round Seamus had blown himself up, this time round he had the focus to actually make the rum.</pre>

<pre>Albus Dumbledore was thrust, unceremoniously, into the waking world. He had no idea where he was, the last thing he remembered was having to have a meeting with his Heads of House and Potter, Bones and Moody. After that… nothing.

Looking around blearily he saw Madam Pomfrey had just thrown open the curtains causing sunlight to pour in and result in his awakening.

"Poppy? Why am I in the Hospital Wing?" He asked.

"You don't remember?" She asked worriedly.

"I seem to be missing a rather large section of memory… nothing since the end of the feast last night." He frowned.

"I'm not surprised really, you hit your head fairly hard." She admonished.

"Did I fall?" He asked, although it was more of a verbal wondering.

"Of course not, no, you managed to over power and explode your wand… you're lucky you still have most of your fingers!" She wagged a finger of her own at him.

Albus quickly looked at his hand and saw that the index and middle finger where missing off his right hand. "By Merlin… what happened?"

"I thought we covered that, Albus, your wand exploded." Poppy began running her wand over him. "Are you experiencing short term memory problems? Are you focusing properly?"

"What? Of course I am." He said angrily. "Wait… my wand?" His face paled.

"Complete ashes, I'm afraid you will have to see Ollivander about a new one." She said absently. "Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get the Wing ready for the day."

Poppy hid a smirk as she bustled away. She hadn't lied, as his wand had exploded slightly when Harry destroyed it. He was lucky to have most of his fingers as Moody and Filius were arguing over how many they should blast off and who got to do it.

+

Back at the Slytherin table the other first years and those that had not participated were staring at Harry.

"What?" He asked uncomfortably.

"Are you really the new Lord Slytherin?" Daphne Greengrass asked.

"Apparently." Harry shrugged unconcerned.

Tracey Davis was white as a ghost like most of her classmates. "But… that means…you…"

"Means what?" Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.

"You're related to You-Know-Who!" Pansy Parkinson hissed.

"Who?"

"You know! You-Know-Who!"

"I don't know who. Last I checked I was related to the Potters… hence my name." Harry said as he put another spoon of porridge in his mouth.

"She's talking about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named." Daphne explained.

"If he can't be named then how am I supposed to know who she's talking about?" Harry frowned. He was really enjoying himself.

"V-V-V-V-"

"Vonder Voman?"

"Who? No! V-V-V-V-"

"Valentino?"

"She means Voldemort!" Came the highly irritated voice of Professor Snape.

The Great Hall was filled with screams and gasps with some people actually diving under the tables and running out the doors.

"Thank you Severus, for that." McGonagall said dryly she said as she stood to go and corral the frightened children.

Harry smirked quietly at the chaos before turning back to his classmates. "I'm not related to Voldemort and stop gasping, he's gone, pitiful excuse for a human that he is."

"If you are not related then how are you the new Lord of Slytherin?" Marcus Flint asked.

"Easy, I kicked his butt as a baby, and now, by Right of Conquest, Magic recognises me as the new Lord Slytherin."</pre>

<pre>"They can't hear us, right?"

"Did you ever hear me talking to any of the other students I sorted whilst you were here? I had a rather long discussion with your young friend, Miss Granger, on why she would do better in Ravenclaw than Gryffindor!"

"Then why didn't you put her there? She's always been the smartest."

"The same reason I put you in Gryffindor." The Hat returned smugly.

"Because she asked you to." Harry sighed.

"Indeed. So, Mr. Potter, would you care to trust my judgement this time round and enter the House of Slytherin? After all, you are the rightful Lord of Slytherin."

"I am?"

"By right of conquest, in this timeline you have defeated that young upstart, Riddle once. In your last timeline you did so nearly once a year! Magic will recognise you as such. Speaking for myself and Hogwarts, we definitely acknowledge your Lordship."

"Wait… I'm only eleven in this timeline, and only barely, aren't I too young?"

"Only by mortal human standards, and magic does not care one whit what mortal humans think. Neither do we for that matter. But we digress, shall you enter the pit of snakes?"

"Would it really make that much of a difference?"

"Mr. Potter… may I call you Harry?"

"Erm… sure."

"I could help you sit here and go through the pros and cons of Slytherin versus Gryffindor, instead I shall give you the one piece of information that will be of most importance to you:

"Slytherins have their own private rooms."

"Sold!"

"SLYTHERIN!" Boomed the Hat into the Great Hall.

+

"Potter is clearly spreading lies and has no place in the noble house of Slytherin!"

Albus' head snapped round to glare at Snape. "I believe it would be in everyone's interest to let the matter drop." He said seriously. He refused to lie just to protect Severus' ego.

"I object!"

All heads snapped back to Harry. "He called me a liar. He also called me names. I demand sanctions!" Harry said as he banged his eleven-year-old fist on the table. He was actually enjoying himself. He hadn't felt this good since he took the luck potion.

+

"Don't you trust me Mr. Potter?" Dumbledore asked slightly hurt, despite the fact that he had no intention of calling either Madam Bones or Alastor Moody.

"Give me one good reason."

"I am a well respected member of the Wizarding community."

"So am I, but you don't seem to trust me. Try again." Harry grinned.

<pre>His alone time was interrupted by the pop of a house elf.

"Master Harry sir, missy Tonks is here." Teeny announced. "She bes looking mad."

Huh, he hadn't seen that coming. "Thank you, Teeny."

The happy little house elf popped away again and left Harry to his thoughts, for what little time he had until his ex-girlfriend barged in. Dora still had a standing invitation to the manor, but he honestly hadn't expected her to come haring after him for that duel as soon as her shift was over.

It wasn't more than a few seconds before he heard her stomping up the hallway and throwing open the door.

"What the hell, Harry?" She demanded. She was dressed in a black tank top(with no bra), ripped jeans, a pair of calf high black boots with a light enchantment on them and her vividly orange-purple hair was spiked around her head like an 80s rock star.

Harry smiled at her. "Hello, Dora. You're looking extra beautiful today."

"Don't try to flatter your way out of this!" She said sternly, ignoring that she was, in fact, flattered.

"Your boobs seem to like it, they perked right up." He pointed out.

Tonks grabbed at her boobs possesively and looked at them sternly. "Don't listen to him, girls!"

"It's too late, Dora. If you didn't want your boobs to rebel against you and start listening to me, then you should have paid more attention to those puppies." Harry said faux sinisterly.

Tonks glared at him for a few moments, but the increasing pinkness of her hair gave away her amusement

Finally she huffed and relaxed her posture. "Alright, enough about my boobs. What the hell were you thinking?"

+

The whole situation was stupid, really. They had broken up over four months ago now, and he'd stopped moping about it a few weeks into that time. He was usually better about letting the past go than this. Of course, he was usually also not still feeling guilty for performing Soul Magic on an unknowing person. On an unknowing person that he really liked at any rate.

"Of course I'm right." Tonks puffed up her chest, wanting to put an end to the slight gloom that had descended just now.

"Careful there, Dora. I hear large breasts can cause back problems." Harry said dryly, gesturing at her now DD-cup chest.

"Shows what you know." She replied haugtily. "Metamorphmagi don't get back problems."

"Well in that case inflate away, Bubbles."

"What did you just call me?!" Tonks demanded, doing her best to keep an angry expression on her face.

"Bubbles the inflatable doll?" He said back innocently. "Or would you prefer Dora the Sexplorer?

Coming from anyone else, she would have been extremely offended by that, but she was familiar with Harry's acerbic sense of humor and knew that he didn't mean anything by it. That he could crack jokes about her abilities without walking on eggshells or being an arse had always been something she'd liked. That didn't mean that he was going to get away with it though.

"Why you little…..!" She growled and pounced, her body growing taller and bulkier as she did so.

"This is new." Harry grunted in effort as the Metamorphmagus continued changing until she was 6'1'' and had noticeable biceps. He was having to exert quite a bit of effort to keep her at bay.

"I've been practicing." Tonks grunted back, continuing to shunt non-critical mass, such as body fat and reproductive organs, into muscle. Her breasts flattened and became distinctly male looking pectorals, which was as weird as ever, but not as weird as suddenly being genderless. It was worth it though, because it allowed her to slap more muscle onto her bones.

"This is so unfair." Harry complained with a strained voice half a minute of roughhousing later. The Metamorphmagus now looked like a serious body builder and had the strength to match. He was very strong for his size and build, but his lightly muscled form couldn't stand up to that even with the runic enhancement.

"Deal with it." She grinned fiercely. Her head might be starting to pound from the effort of sustaining a transformation so far outside of her usual body mass, but the sweet taste of victory made it all worth it.

And then, with all the dramatic effect of an avalanche, her jeans burst open at the seams, exposing pretty much everything. They hadn't been fully skintight jeans, but they had definitely been meant for female legs and not the tree trunks she'd turned them into. It was pure luck that her boots had been bought in Diagon Alley and had a resizing enchantment on them, a must have for a Metamorphmagus really.

Tonks yelped loudly and jumped away, covering her exposed groin with her hands. Her morphed muscles quickly deflated and left her standing there in a badly stretched tank top and ruined pants.

Meanwhile, Harry had collapsed into helpless hysterics and was cackling madly, tears streaming from his eyes from the force of his laughter.

"It's not funny!" Tonks wailed, her entire body turning as red as her hair, which was now a color that would make a lobster look pink.

Harry did not reply verbally, unless crawling across the floor and nearly blacking out from oxygen deprivation counted.

+

As he walked back through the front door of Potter Manor, Harry mused that the final confrontation with his foster parents had gone rather smoothly. It was amazing how easy these things were when only one side had the priviliege of speaking.</pre>

<pre>As time wore on, the Slytherins seemed increasingly sceptical of Lockhart's claims of glorious victory, though they didn't seem to doubt Harry had by some means seen the Chamber of Secrets with Lockhart accompanying him. The four girls cornered him out in the grounds one day and quizzed him a bit about events. "No-one defeats ghouls with a tea strainer, like in his books. And he's changed his story for the Prophet about how he found the Chamber of Secrets – twice," Pansy said accusingly.

"Well, he's more interested in telling the story dramatically, so some fine details might fall by the wayside occasionally," said Harry with a shrug and a smile.

"I read in Witch Weekly that Lockhart said the Basilisk was blue, but when you were telling us about it in the hospital wing you said it was green. What colour is it really, Harry?" asked Daphne sweetly.

Harry thought he'd better back Lockhart up. The forgetful git. "Well, it was a blue-green, a kind of turquoise I guess. More blue on the whole, I suppose."

The girls all grinned at each other knowingly, in a way that made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand up.

"What?"

"Professor Lockhart hasn't done any interviews for Witch Weekly yet. And in the Prophet, he said it was green," Daphne said.

Harry scowled at them. "Well, it was a greeny-blue. I'm no expert at colours. And I didn't get to see it for very long before it crumbled to dust."

"Why are you backing his ridiculous claims?" demanded Pansy, stomping her foot crossly and pouting unattractively. "We know he's full of rubbish. If he's a real hero I'll cut my hair." Daphne gasped in shocked amusement, and Millicent giggled.

Harry thought for a moment and decided to share a bit of the truth, since the cover story obviously wasn't working. They were his friends, and could probably be trusted not to turn on him. Of course, he'd thought that about Ron too. Still, they were sneaky types who might be able to give him a little advice, which he could sorely use.

"He's blackmailing me," he admitted. They gasped in surprise. "Not that it's all that bad, mind you! Or even all true – it's not. And I won't say what, so don't ask. But if he started slandering me in public, I think people might believe him. And he said if it came down to his word against mine, they'd make us both take Veritaserum and ask all kinds of prying questions. Do you think the Aurors would really do that?"</pre>

<pre>He giggled again, people yelled, and he told them to go bugger themselves. He even included lurid description on how
to do it and a way to make the equipment the proper size. It was dead quiet after that and Harry grinned. He knew he
wasn't quite the person he had been when they brought him here. Sometimes lessons were hard to learn, but the
Wizarding world made sure he wouldn't ever forget this lesson.
Good deeds brought pain. Rescuing people only brought ridicule, hate, and useless gratitude from the very people you
tried to help. Yes, that seemed right. His ability to trust was gone he realized. Friends betrayed you when it was
convenient, yes. Promises were just bluffs until it was no longer useful, then written off as a waste of time.

/

"Anything on Mr. Riddle?"
Moody shrugged. "Five families were killed in the last three weeks. All of them muggles with a muggle born witch or
wizard in the family. The Ministry Aurors showed up about an hour after each attack, cleaned up the mess, cleaned out
the refrigerator, and made off with all the silverware."

/

"The Git will be caught eventually Herm." Ron muttered, jealous flashing in his eyes.
Hermione sniffed. "When will you declare him innocent Albus?"
"When the time is right."
"And when will that be?"
"As I said Miss Granger, when I feel the time is right." Albus said, showing a little more force than he really needed to.
She backed down and Albus relaxed again.
"Alright sir."
"Just kill him on sight like the Ministry says and we get ten thousand galleons, I'm all for that."
"He's innocent Ron, remember?"
"Only when Dumbledore says so Herms, until then he's fair game."

/

"When did you two arrive?" Kingsley sighed.
"Dumbledore sent us. He said the ward he put around the house that would capture Harry went off." Fred explained.
That perked Kingsley up. "So Potter is captured, let's go have…"
"I'm afraid not." George said.
"Oh?" Kingsley wasn't surprised anymore.
"The Headmaster isn't a very…"
"…happy Wizard right now." They grinned.
"Why?"
"All of Mrs. Figgs cats…
"…enlarged to the size of lions…
"…appeared in his office, freaked out…
"…and tore the place apart!" The twins yelled and started snickering.
"The cats left the office, raced through the school…"
"…and are now sleeping and shedding hair all over the Slytherin Common room."

+

"…and that's everything that's happened since early this morning sir." Kingsley said.
A rather harried looking Dumbledore looked as if he had aged to his true age in the last few hours. Giant cats running
through the castle, his office destroyed, the Slytherin common room would take weeks to clean out after all those cats
used it as a litter box. "You say Harry turned his relatives into animals?"

+

"Um…"
"What?"
"Mrs. Figg wants her cats back in one piece or she says you'll be sorry you ever crossed her."
/

Harry wasn't sure he needed to 'punish' the muggles for his troubles, but several of his victims lived in the muggle world.
So the elves were told to stir things up a bit, mix things around, and have fun. Elves being rather literal at the best of
times, took this to mean that every car in the neighborhood should be moved around.
A random bit of hide and seek.
Just to put his stamp on the prank, Harry had them repaint the cars in random colors. Once that was done had all the
street names changed to give directions to the nearest bathroom and nodded in satisfaction. He glanced back down the
street at Hermione's house. After listening to her stick up for him at one of the Order meetings and even quit them, he
figured he might as well talk to her. Of course he needed to prank her first.

/

Avery rolled to his feet and suddenly transformed into a large sheep with horns. He charged at Harry with a loud Baaa
sound. For a second all Harry could do was gape at the man's animagus form. Thinking on the fly, Harry used a quick
levitation charm to send the sheep flying into the wall, where it's horns got stuck in the wood.

/

Meanwhile, upstairs, Kingsley and Mad 'Eye' Moody along with about five junior Aurors were responding to a tip. The first
clue that any of them had that something was the sheep hanging on the wall, still struggling to get tree. Kingsley and
Mad Eye paled as they realized that this might be a Potter attack.
"We better be careful people, this might be Potter's handy work.
Suddenly hundreds of leafy green tentacles shot out of the basement and wrapped the Aurors up completely, lifted them
into the air, and started playing toss. At first they were too shocked to respond much, but then Kingsley suddenly found
himself being flung right under a miniature Hippo.
"RUN, RUN FOR YOUR SANITY!" The dark skinned man screamed. He managed to land on the floor, roll to his feet, and
started hopping for the front door. Some of his men tried and failed completely.
"BHAAAA!" The sheep yelled.
From the outside the house seemed to smirk as it shuddered once and rose up on a pair of chicken legs, looked
around, and raced down the street. Inside the house everything started falling over and flying around. The tentacles
started throwing around everything.
"AGHAAAAAAAAAA!" Ten Aurors, a Hippo, Sheep, and barely conscious Ermine screamed in fear. The House continued
running late into the night. It only took time to stop at Number Four Privet Drive and take a leak on the roof. Once that was
gone, all that water from the basement, it raced off across the country.

/

Every mirror held a different joke that was taking place at that instant. It was currently snowing inside the headmaster's
office. Bill Weasley couldn't figure out why that goblin over there had taken such an interest in the back of his pants.
Snape had developed a Doxy invasion in his potions lab. The minister was turning into a skunk.
There was a house on chicken legs doing a cross country dash with it's tongue lolling out. She could just make out
people and plants through the windows. Harry stood beside her and grinned. "I didn't even come up with half of these,
the elves do it themselves. Though I take credit for the house. I heard about it once when I was a kid."
Hermione could only gape as Ollivander's wands started pairing off and drumming themselves on anything solid. This
included Olivander himself, who was soon cowering under his counter. Then Hermione gasped and punched Harry in
the arm. "I can't believe you did that!"
"What did I do?"
She pointed at a mirror off in the corner. Turning to the side he took a minute to look it over and started laughing.
Lockhart's singing Valentines Day dwarves had invaded Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. They could only watch in horror
as rather wide dwarves wearing pink leotards and fairy wings, smoking cigars, and bad attitudes started slapping
students around to get them to declare their love.
Harry blinked. "That's a great idea, but it ain't mine."
"Who else could have done it?"
Suddenly Dobby is looking up at them and giggling like a schoolgirl. "Dobby did it."

/

Halfway across the country people were still trying to figure out how Potter had changed the Hogwarts express into
Timithy the Toot Toot complete with a face. It could talk and didn't like all the mischief the students had gotten up to during
its years in service and refused to move until everyone apologized for taking him for granted.

/

"Aren't you worried that people might overhear you here? I didn't see you put up Notice-Me-Not spells."
"Got something better going." Harry said absently as he sniffed his green bread and gave it a nibble.
"What's that? Everyone seems to be looking this way, so it must not be that good a spell."
"Actually, it's working perfectly."
"Oh?"
"Yep." Harry said evasively.
"What exactly are they seeing?"
Harry smirked. "Why the best deterrent for eavesdroppers ever invented."
"Quit avoiding the question. What are they seeing?"
"Me and you snogging each other's brains out." Harry explained. "Right now they can see you sitting in my lap as I have
my hand up under your shirt…"
With a screech Hermione threw her Butterbeer in his face and walked out of the Hogshead. Harry ignored the Butterbeer
dripping off his face as he finished off the rest of his meal. He couldn't help smirking a little as he watched Hermione
pacing back and forth in front of the doorway.
Once he was finished eating he left a tip and headed for the doorway and let the ward fall. Everyone in the bar groaned
as they realized it was only an illusion and went back to drinking. Hermione gave him 'The Look' as he exited the place
and reared back to slap him.

/

He wandered over to the library and breathed a sigh of relief that it hadn't moved to a different part of the house. He
headed over to the Book of Knowledge sitting on it's stand in the middle of the circular room and flipped through it until
he came to the newest pages. A lot of the spells he'd used recently came from the book and gave him a serious
advantage.
The ups and downs of magic of the years fascinated him to no end. Instead of focusing on wars and goblins like most
history books, Harry was learning about the rise of magic during the years before Merlin showed up. Professor Binns
would have gladly possessed the nearest teenage girl and bore his children for this information. He already knew how to
start training himself to do wandless magic too, opening Portals, and even confuse modern day Wards.
Life was good. And the Book of Knowledge was a gift from the gods.

"Albus?"
Dumbledore was slightly drunk. He glanced up from his desk and grunted. "What is it Aberforth?'
"Could you send a half dozen or so students down to the Hogs Head?"
"Sure, but why?"
"Well it seems that sometime during the night someone broke in and filled the place, floor to ceiling, with plushies." He
tossed one through the fire.
Dumbledore caught and found him self looking at a tiny little stuffed doll of Alastor Moody. The doll sneered at him.
"CONSTANT VILLAGENCE!"
Fawks screeched in shock from his perch.
"Yeah, they do that too." Aberforth admitted.
"Just how many are we talking about here?"
"Oh, close to a fifty thousand or so. The bar is so full that the only thing holding them in was the doors and windows. If
those go they'll be all over the place."
Albus sighed. "Harry."
Aberforth just shrugged. "Probably."
"I'll send some elves."
"Send some crates, I think I can sell these things." Aberforth said suddenly.
"What makes you say that?"
"I just made ten sickles selling a Dark Lord Plushy." He said excitedly.
Albus started to bang his head against his desk.
"CONSTANT VILLAGENCE!" Plushy Mad Eye screamed and waved his wand up and down.

The one[memo] after that described a hoard of bunny girls invading magical Amsterdam to dance and do what bunny's do.
Surprisingly there wasn't one complaint about the bunny girls, though another stack held several requests for more.
Problem was, no one could figure out where the girls came from or where they got to the next morning. No one was
missing and tests showed that they were not transfigured animals.
Hmm, another memo from Fudge requesting a couple of the girls to be sent to his house. She shuddered, crumpled it
up, and tossed it in the fireplace. It joined several others that were burning quite well.</pre>

<pre>Harry thought it would be nice to be home again for Christmas, and away from suspicious glances and just-as-irritating falsely cheerful attempts at friendships. The Hufflepuff students' tendency to try to be overly friendly had spread to the logical Ravenclaws. The Gryffindors were split between backing one of their own, and watching him suspiciously. The Slytherins were almost uniformly polite. Some of them bowed to him (bringing up the Weasley twins' count nicely) and if they ever encountered him alone in a corridor they were sure to "casually" either mention either their blood heritage, or ramble oddly about what subjects they were impressively good at or how rich their family was. Harry thought they might be trying to impress him with their potential usefulness to a young Dark Lord. Harry hated to think what the person really behind the attacks thought of it all. He'd had a few anonymous owls from students saying things along the lines of, "I'm watching you, Parselmouth!" He was often ready to cast a defensive spell at a moment's notice; not realising that his battle-ready twitchiness was giving people an odd impression of his demeanour and making matters worse.

This year, Harry had a massive pile of Yule gifts. He'd berated Pansy for encouraging the rumour that giving him a gift would ensure you wouldn't be petrified, but she just sniffed and told him off for his ingratitude and ungraciousness. She was helping. Weren't they family?

Hermione was very pleased to listen to him complain about Pansy for a change, but was reasonably gracious in victory.

"Well, currying favour with the rich and powerful is a traditional part of wizarding society," she said. "It's not nice, but there you have it. It's an oligarchy, with the trappings of democracy. Change will only come slowly."

"I'm not sure what some of that means, but I can explain about currying favour," volunteered Neville. "Some families are patrons of others, so the lesser family is expected to provide social support and what favours they can, in return for the magical protection and financial support offered by the more prosperous and powerful family. It's a very old tradition."

"Sometimes I really wonder why you want to stay here, Hermione?" mused Harry.

"And miss out on learning magic?!" she said, aghast.

"I mean after Hogwarts."

"Oh. Well, society can change. But nothing changes without people to make things change. People working together. Like we are starting to – with house-elves!" she said optimistically.

"I think I know now why you're in Gryffindor, despite your inner raven," said Harry teasingly.

"Be careful with your thank you letters," advised Neville. "A patron-client relationship doesn't happen instantly, it builds over time. You'll want to keep track of who's currying your favour on an ongoing basis, and who's just being scared and polite with a token gift or one-off letter."

"Pansy gave me a template for thank you letters…" Harry said uncertainly.

Neville sighed, and insisted on seeing it. He made a lot of corrections to it before giving it back. "That was perfect how it was – if you wanted to hint that you're the Heir and want more gifts and favours, without saying so outright. My corrections make it say the opposite, basically."

"It seemed harmless enough, thanking people for their gifts and saying how I'm just an ordinary student and can't protect anyone…"

"It's all in the implications," said Neville, apologetically. "Like this bit, '…as far as my limited talents allow I hope I can assist in the protection of other students at the school, but I am not so arrogant as to assume I can rein in the mysterious creature plaguing Hogwarts and save everyone.' You see? It's subtly hinting at your talent as a Parseltongue or maybe in magic, and that your ability to protect students from the monster may be limited to a few, not everyone. And that maybe you're the one controlling it, since you could possibly rein it in to a limited extent."

"I didn't get that at all," sighed Harry. "It seemed innocuous."

"It sounds alright to me too," agreed Hermione.

"But some students will take it differently," Neville insisted.

"She might mean well but she's so pushy sometimes - she always thinks she knows best. I told her I didn't want people giving me gifts but she didn't listen," whined Harry.

"You need to stop relying on her so much for advice on wizarding culture," chided Hermione. "Neville and Ron know quite a lot too, you know. Even I read up on it, now. It's not all bad; the attitude to women's rights has historically been centuries ahead of its time, and cultural tolerance for other species is much better than you might expect."

"I don't have time to read for fun so much these days," Harry said defensively. "All my spare time is going on studying normal subjects. Asking friends for advice is easier and quicker. But I will ask you guys more, alright?"

"We're here for you when you need us, Harry," Neville said, and Hermione nodded her agreement.

+

Neville eventually found their compartment, and at Harry's immediate loud insistence that of course he was welcome to join them, the girls didn't say a word in protest, or even so much as roll their eyes. Harry was very pleased. He really wanted his friends to try and get along with each other better, and Neville was the one most tolerated by the Slytherins, and vice versa.

"Show him your gift, Harry!" Pansy demanded.

"Of course, my delicate flower of a cousin. Since you asked so nicely," drawled Harry, sarcasm clear in his voice. Pansy looked taken aback, and Daphne smiled to see Harry correcting Pansy's manners.

Neville peeked hesitantly inside the basket.

"Are those eucalypt leaves? What species of moss is it?"

"Uh, you did notice the snake, right?"

"Yes. But the plant matter for the nest engages my interest more. It is just a snake after all, and I am sure it's not dangerous or you would have conveyed that information to me immediately."</pre>

<pre>Harry was in History of Magic when Neville kicked his ankle.

He had his foam earplugs in, and was bent over his desk totally absorbed in writing a Tutor-marked Assignment for Science, all about Mendelian inheritance of genetic traits. As Neville alerted him to the rare need to pay attention to the teacher with a swift kick, he looked up from his TMA to see Professor Binns facing the class for a change, rather than the blackboard.

"Goblins were to blame, sir," he said in a confident voice, taking a wild guess as to what Binns might have asked him while palming his earplugs out as discreetly as he could.

Binns looked at him quizzically, and a few people in the class snickered. Neville looked apologetically at Harry, and silently mouthed, "Sorry!"

"Well Mr. Black, I don't believe they had much influence on the Chamber of Secrets, though some do say that goblins helped build or ward Hogwarts, but that's a matter of much debate," said Binns. "If they know anything about the existence or location of the legendary Chamber they are keeping that knowledge to themselves."

Harry sat blushing while the class listened enraptured as Hermione prompted Binns to elaborate further on the legend of the hidden Chamber of Secrets, and the Heir of Slytherin who was the only one who could open it and control the monster within.

"Next time, pass me a note," Harry muttered to Neville.

+

"Trust a Slytherin to be buddies with the Heir," muttered someone.

"Well, I've certainly got nothing to worry about," she said, smugly, linking her arm around Harry's.

"I thought you had History of Magic this morning?" he whispered.

"Like I said – a free period," she whispered back, conspiratorially. "Tracey takes notes for us all."

"Well, I'm not going near him." There was a murmuring of agreement, and Harry felt a bit sick to his stomach.

"I might remind you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's…" said Ernie nervously.

Pansy snickered at him.

"Do you think I'm the Heir of Slytherin, Pansy?" asked Harry seriously.

"If he is, you can't really trust him," warned Hannah, anxiously. "It might be safer…" she trailed off, chewing at her lip.

Harry looked worriedly at Pansy, but she just snorted and rolled her eyes. "Don't be ridiculous," she said, turning to face the crowd. "If he is the Heir, then the safest place to be is as a loyal friend at his side. And if he's not, then being his friend is no risk at all and he'll appreciate the support!"

She turned to Harry. "Honestly, you have to spell everything out for Hufflepuffs. House of the 'loyal' indeed. They're definitely not the house of the smart, cunning or brave, that's manifestly obvious." She turned and sneered at them all.

"Thanks, Pansy. I think."

"For what it's worth, I don't think you're the Heir."

"Thanks," he smiled gratefully.

"Unless you are the Heir, in which case, my belief in you is unwavering, and just not something I want to talk about publicly." She grinned at him. "Hypothetically."

"Covering all the options, aren't you?" Harry didn't even know what she really believed; she'd sounded pretty sincere both times.

"Well, you are a Parselmouth!"

The Hufflepuffs seemed quiet and thoughtful as they listened to their interchange.

"Can I carry your bag to your next class for you, Potter?" offered Abbott, when there was a pause in their conversation.

"Do you need help with your homework?" said another, and they started pressing in around him.

"You know I didn't mean any offence with my comments," said Lily worriedly. "It was just idle speculation."

"You know I've always liked you, Harry. I think of you as a friend. A very good friend," said a third Hufflepuff earnestly, whose name Harry didn't even know.

"We've been friends for ages, right Harry?" said Ernie anxiously.

Pansy seemed vastly amused at Harry's new plight. He looked at her pleadingly and whispered a request for help, but she only egged them on.

"Well, you say you're a friend, but I don't know what you've done for him to demonstrate that. I wonder if you've even bought him a gift for Yule?" she hinted heavily.</pre>

<pre>"So are all your family wizards?" she asked Ron curiously.

"Er – yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."

"Why? What's wrong with being an accountant? Did he embezzle company funds or something?" she said, perplexed.

Neville tried to explain. "Ron means he's a Squib."

"You're ashamed to have a family member with no magic? You don't even talk about him? The books I read said that kind of prejudiced attitude died with the war!" said an outraged Hermione.

Harry thought that the Weasleys were clearly one of those bigoted families his aunt had warned him about. He wasn't sure about Neville's family yet - there was some mystery there - but Neville himself was clearly alright.

"I didn't mean it like that. And we're Light sided all the way," insisted Ron. "My dad loves Muggles."

Hermione settled down after a bit more reassurance, but Harry's opinion was set. Ron's dad thought of normal people as being amusing pets, just like his aunt said. As the conversation continued about Muggles Ron's ignorance became obvious - Ron couldn't even pronounce words like electricity, and didn't know what a television set was. His family must be very isolated from the real world indeed. Harry thought that Neville seemed ignorant of many normal things too, but was generally more polite about it.</pre>

"Hermione, I'm not sure if you saw the new Educational Decree—" Septima.

"I did, Septima. But that's not why I'm here."

"It's not?"

"No. I was wondering if you would be interested in a new class I'm teaching called Advanced Topics in Mathematics. You see, I checked, and classes that aren't accredited by the Ministry don't require a teaching certificate. Class starts right now, and tuition is one sickle per week."

Septima gaped for a moment, then laughed loudly. "Hermione, I know you don't like defining people by their houses, but the sheer Gryffindor audacity of that plan is brilliant."</pre>

<pre>Professor McGonagall was thrilled to bits with his increasingly advanced Transfiguration skills, and Hermione had long since resignedly conceded the top spot in the class to him in all practical exercises. Though McGonagall didn't like it when he tried to smuggle out the animals they were supposed to be transforming out of class for his own private Transfiguration experiments.

"Mr. Potter," she said crisply, "the goal of this class is to transform your hedgehog into a pincushion, not to try and smuggle it into your bag while transforming a quill into a decoy pincushion. That is hardly the standard of behaviour I expect of my Gryffindors." She didn't take points off him though – she never did. He was usually quite the teacher's pet in class.

The Dementors were wary of Harry after attacked them with all his Pokémon (including the formidable Hedwig). And doubly cautious after he summoned his Pikachu Patronus to attack and weaken them, as Sirius slumped unconscious to the ground in the face of the dark swarm draining away all hope and joy. But then they became positively terrified of Harry after he then threw a Pokéball at the nearest weakened Dementor that hovered threateningly over the unconscious form of Sirius Black. The Pokéball wobbled for a little while, but then it flashed and lay still.

"Yes!" Harry said, triumphantly holding up the Pokéball after it flew to his hand. "I caught a Dementor!" He posed, and his Pokémon all cheered with him, but there were no other people left there who were conscious and able to appreciate the moment.

The remaining Dementors promptly fled from him, unused to suffering terror and despair instead of inducing it in others.

"I think you'll make a nice Haunter," Harry mused thoughtfully, looking at the Pokéball in his hand.</pre>

<pre>Harry turned to regard her once more, his eyes piercing hers. "I won't deny I enjoy spending time with you Tonks. But..."

A small smile had begun to break over the metamorph's face before it was dashed like being hit with cold water at Harry's final word.

"But… what?" Tonks asked, with a very soft voice.

"But do you really want to know what I've been thinking more than half the time I spend with you?" Harry asked, a dangerous quality in his voice.

"What's that?" Tonks asked.

"Half the time I want to kiss you," Harry said, his voice turning soft.

Tonks broke into a smile and opened her mouth slowly to reply to that, intending to tell him that wasn't something she'd protest but he continued before she could respond.

"And the other half of the time I want to drag you into a room, lock the door and not let either of us out until you're screaming at the top of your lungs for me to shag your brains out." Harry finished, his voice taking on a harsh tone. "And I don't know how much of that is me and how much is… him."

Tonks mouth opened and shut slowly before she was able to formulate a reply, "And… your solution to wanting a roll in the hay… the same roll in the hay that I would gladly give you three or four times a day, by the way… is to hop into the Veil of death? Seems… like an overreaction, Harry. I know Molly Weasley is your mother figure, but that prude shouldn't be your role model concerning premarital sex."

Harry narrowed his eyes at that and glared at her.

Tonks shrugged, "Seriously, if you wanted a romp, I would be more than happy to oblige. You aren't the only one who had those thoughts about us, and about far more than us just kissing."</pre>

Harry frowned and stared at it for a moment, "August 1st, 1976."

"Do you know what this means?" Tonks demanded when, after a dozen seconds that was all Harry had said.

"Hell is really behind in news circulation?" Harry inquired dryly.</pre>

<pre>It wasn't until after they'd hit the Prophet and were half way through Hogwarts that an uncomfortable idea formed. How in the hell were they going to get away? It was a question Luna found hilarious

"We are planning to get away, aren't we?" he continued, just a bit nervously.

"Of course we are, Harry," Luna said between giggles. "You didn't think this was some crazy stunt to do as much damage as possible before going out in a blaze of glory, did you?"

"No. It's just... aren't they going to be motivated to hunt us to the ends of the earth?" he asked nervously.

"Probably," she agreed unconcerned.

"So?" he asked.

"So we're going to another one," Luna explained.

"Space travel?!" he exclaimed, wide eyed.

"Don't be ridiculous." Luna sniffed. "Everybody knows there's no air in space. Not to mention the distances involved."

"What are we going to do then?" he asked.

"We're going to hop dimensions of course," she said matter of factly.

"Of course," he echoed weakly. "Do you know how to do that?"

"No, but how hard could it be?" she replied unconcerned. Considering what Wizarding kind had accomplished, despite being complete morons most of the time, she was sure the pair of them could do anything they set their minds to with a bit of effort.

"Ms. Granger. I am quite sure that I've spent the last several decades eliminating all references to the ritual you just performed. Where did you learn of it?" his tone implied that he was not in the mood to play around.

"The Black library," the girl squeaked. "I've been corresponding with Sirius since the day the names came out of that damned cup."

"Of course." The old man's eyes closed. "In the future, Ms. Granger, please check with me before doing something like this again," he finished, sounding very old and very tired.

"Yes, Professor," the girl agreed. "Who was that?"

"You don't know?" has asked, surprised.

"The ritual said it would summon someone who could help Olivia with the tournament," the girl explained.

"I see." He nodded to himself and stroked his beard.

"Professor?" she asked, breaking his train of thought.

"Unless I'm much mistaken, that was Death and his handmaiden," Dumbledore replied.

"W-what?!" Hermione froze, a drop of urine soaking into her underwear as the enormity of her mistake hit her.</pre>

<pre>Another thing that could break the mind of a vampire was destroying their mate. Aro had, very few times, tested the endurance of a vampire as they were forced to watch their mate being tortured. My whole body shuddered at the memories, and I wailed pitifully – shocked and disgusted.

He wanted to see the effect watching your mate being tortured. This had been one of Aro's very first tests, and I was glad of how quickly he abolished the trials. He even went so far as claim that mates should be above the law, so that no vampire could be condemned with having their mate killed or similar as punishment. Punishing a vampire by killing their mate would ruin the surviving vampire for the rest of existence. To see what had happened to the vampires who lost their mates was beyond horrible.</pre>

<pre>"Just throwing magic behind your willpower is more like controlled Accidental Magic." He went on with his explanation, neglecting to mention that he had spent years doing just that or that he still did it when he didn't have time to think. "Accidental Magic...well, it's like throwing a tantrum and having the Universe give in because it doesn't want to listen to your shit anymore. That's why it generally only happens to children or people under extreme emotional duress. It tends to be wild and unpredictable and controlling it is very hard. It will also give you a splitting headache more commonly known as magical exhaustion because you're essentially trying to bully the natural order of the world into submission instead of creating a temporary localized state of altered reality.

+

There were a few moments of silence...well not really silence because Luna was humming something, but there was no talking. Then it was broken.

"Oh, I just had an idea!" Luna exclaimed. "Do you want to paint each other's toenails? I heard that girlfriends do that for each other and I'm sure it applies to harem buddies too."

"But we are not in a 'arem togezzer." Fleur felt compelled to point out.

"But you want us to be and I want us to be, which only leaves Harry and he's much too sensitive about his masculinity to get his toenails painted." Luna counter argued.

The warped logic was strangely persuasive even if the moon brained girl hadn't gotten it 100% correct. Fleur did not, strictly speaking, want Luna in a harem with her, but she was quite sure that attempting to separate her from Harry could only end in tears(and possibly blood considering the events of the second task), probably her own, so she had accepted that Luna was there to stay.

+

After extricating himself from the clutches of two lusty females and making use of their shower, Harry had decided to fly to London in his raven form and spend some time in an internet café catching up to stuff that he had missed in the normal world over the past couple of months. Magic was great and he wouldn't trade it for anything, but he did miss technology sometimes. Not being especially politically inclined, he ended up spending most of his time reading about the recently video games that he was probably never going to get around to playing. It was hard to get excited about the newest fantasy game when you could throw your own fireballs. Or if the bloated cancerous mass known as Electronic Arts had reached out from the Pit of Inescapable Mediocrity with its slimy tentacles and used them to repeatedly violate any good idea that wandered into reach until said good idea was left more abused and ruined than a top of the line sex doll shared between fifteen people.

+

Luna and Fleur were sitting together on the bed, apparently having been deep in conversation before his arrival.

"Did I miss something?" He asked, still quite baffled.

"Fleur and I are having a girls day." Luna volunteered happily. "We painted each others nails. Look!"

She extended her legs to present her toenails to Harry, which were now a pale pink that went well with her blonde hair and complexion.

"Nice?" Harry guessed, knowing nothing about nail painting.

"Show him yours, Fleur." Luna urged.

The veela looked reluctant to Harry's gaze, but she did it anyway. He had to bite his lip when he saw what Luna had done to the poor veela's toenails. They looked like something that you might see while on a psychedelic acid trip.

"Fabulous." He said, still trying not to laugh.

Fleur ignored his obvious amusement by adopting a dignified air of low level snobbery.

"That's what I told her, but Fleur keeps insisting that less is more, which really makes no sense." Luna said with a nod.

"We can't all be as wise as you, Luna." Harry said agreeably. This day was turning out to be friggin' amazing.

"Hmmm, you'll have to explain what wisdom has to do with toenails later, Harry. I'll go play with myself in the Room of Requirement while you and Fleur talk." And with that she put on her shoes and left.

Harry wasn't sure if Luna's words were meant to be as dirty as they sounded and figured that he probably never would. She had such a mastery of ambiguous statements that you couldn't even tell if she was doing it on purpose or not.

+

Not wanting to feel like a scolded child in front of an annoyed parent, she got up from the bed as well and stepped in front of him. "Why did you ignore me zen?"

"I just got out of a relationship, Fleur." Harry explained. "I'm not looking to jump back into one."

That was a possibility she had taken into account, but she was sure she could convince him to change his mind. Resistant to the Allure or not, she had never heard of a man sharing a veela's bed and not wanting to come back.

"I understand, 'Arry." Fleur said softly, stepping so far into his personal space that she was practically breathing against his lips. "But could you 'elp me take care of my needs at least?"

"I would love to..." Harry said back equally softly, their lips almost touching. Then he took a step back. "Unfortunately, I've spent the whole day goofing off and I need to get some training done."

"What?" Fleur asked, numb with disbelief.

"I have people out to kill me, I can't afford to skimp out on training." He explained. It was one of the main reasons that he still hadn't fucked any of the bolder fangirls, it would wreck his schedule. The other reason was that teenaged girls were prone to thinking that sex equaled a relationship. That was one bit of drama he simply did not need, not when he had a young middle aged woman bored with her life to vent his lust on.

"But..." Fleur still could not believe that she had just been so casually rejected. That simply did not happen.</pre>

<pre>The lift reached the bottom and the doors opened with a chime. Harry stepped out, followed by a jauntily grinning Sirius Black.

"Good morning, Amelia!" Sirius greeted the woman exuberantly. "You are looking positively stunning today. Is that a new haircut? No. Wait. Don't tell me. Your monocle has been freshly polished."

While Nymphadora Tonks snorted, Madam Bones cast him a dry look, even as she pocketed her monocle. "Try to act with a bit more decorum, Black. I know that is difficult for a rapscallion such as yourself, but this is a serious moment."

"Aye! Sirius it is indeed."

Harry gave Madam Bones a frustrated look. "Please don't mention serious anywhere around Sirius."

"I apologize." Madam Bones was chagrined. "It seems I let the seriousness of the moment get to me."

"Well, I think we could all stand to be a little more Sirius," Sirius said.

Harry and Madam Bones both sighed. Behind her, Kingsley nudged Tonks, who was stifling her giggles by shoving a fist into her mouth.

"Just follow me," Madam Bones muttered.</pre>

<pre>Finally it was time for Sirius. Lily tensed up slightly, and wondered how this would play out. It could go really well, or really horrible.

"Last but not least!" Cornelius said, "Lord Black? Let's hear the final proposal, so we can finish this very successful and very interesting Winter Solstice Session long before we predicted!"

"Thank you, Cornelius," Sirius said, standing up. "You might have noticed, I did not refer to you as Minister Fudge. Why? Because I call for a Vote of No Confidence against Cornelius Fudge!"

Lily held back a smile as several gasps were heard around the Council Room. Fudge's face was purple and red, his mouth opening and closing like a fish.

Soon, they found themselves in front of what appeared to be an elevator. The door opened and Algie led them inside. Harry's eyes widened as he looked around. It looked like a normal elevator, but there were several more buttons then there usual would be for even a Boston skyscraper. As he looked around at the buttons, he suddenly wondered why all of this seemed vaguely familiar.

"Thinking this looks familiar, aren't you, Harry?" Algie asked.

"Um... yes," Harry said, "Why...?"

"Welcome to the inspiration behind Roald Dahl's Wonka-vator in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Algie said, grinning.

Harry looked back at Algie, thinking the man was joking.

"Roald Dahl was a Muggleborn wizard, Harry," Algie said. "He visited the Department of Mysteries once. He loved this elevator. Though he didn't quite understand it. Do you remember what the elevator did in his story?"

"It went in all kinds of directions – and flew," Harry said.

"This one doesn't do that," Algie said; he pointed to a particular button. "Press that button."

Harry pressed it. The Elevator didn't move at all. Nor did it make noise or vibrate. And yet the door that had closed, now opened again."

"Stay here, Harry," Algie said, "What do you see?"

Harry looked into the room they had entered. He snorted at what he saw.

"Uh... a bathroom?" he asked.

"That would be my guess too," Sirius said, with a snicker.

Algie pressed a button and the door closed. Then he ran his fingers over a button, and pressed one. The door opened again. Harry looked out. The Elevator hadn't moved, however they were now looking at a different room.

"Welcome to the Hall of Prophecies," Algie said, as he stepped out of the elevator, "Follow me everyone."

"We didn't go anywhere!" Harry said, as he walked out of the elevator.

"Yes, we did," Algie said, "The Elevator didn't, but we did."

"Best not ask what he means, Harry," Lily said, "It is why this place is called the Department of Mysteries."

"A proper name," Harry muttered.

+

"The Veil of Death?" Harry asked.

"If anything goes through the Veil, it is destroyed," Algie said, "Be it an object, or a living thing. Not even Unspeakables are sure what is actually on the other side of the Veil, because none of us has ever dared to enter it."

"So how do you know it is destroyed?" Sirius asked. "It could just be a Veil to a deep cavern in Timbuktu."

"The Veil of Death is used for executions that are more humane than a Dementor's Kiss," Algie said, "The first criminal we sent through the Veil, we checked the Gringotts Records – if anyone can tell you someone is dead, it is Gringotts, if they have an account there. The Goblins confirmed the person was dead, so I doubt they were in a cavern in Timbuktu."

"Unless they died from a great fall into the cavern," Sirius said.

"Believe me, Black," Algie said, "Anything you can argue with me about the Veil, we've argued about it. Tossing Horcruxes into the Veil is a last-ditch situation. We're well aware that they could – as you put it - end up in a cavern in Timbuktu, and not destroyed that way. So we try to destroy it other ways. There is also the fact that some of these Horcruxes Voldemort used are ancient and priceless artifacts, so we don't want to destroy them."</pre>

<pre>As Hermione joined them, having just come down, Wendell stood up straight and said, "Now, you two..."

Harry focussed his full attention on him.

"I've spoken with the aurors and they'll be keeping an eye on you," he firmly said. "So, no funny business while we're not here. Got it?"

"Dah-deeee!" Hermione whined, while madly blushing.

"Yes, Sir," Harry immediately and firmly replied. "I have your trust and will not abuse it."

"I know, Harry," he replied. "I'm just invoking 'Father's Prerogative' by warning you."

"Yes, Wendell," said Harry, more relaxed.

That the senior auror had told him the aurors wouldn't step in, even if the two decided to consummate their relationship in the middle of the parlour floor, was beside the point. He'd talked to them.

"Sorry, Sir," the auror had apologised. "But, we're here to ensure the safety of Lord Potter and... now that he and your daughter are soon to be in a Betrothal Agreement, from what I hear... she's included in that too.

"Under our law; they are both over thirteen years of age, there is less than a two year age gap between them, Lord Potter does not hold a position of authority over your daughter and, if it happens, they would both be consenting. As such, we would be required to simply give them privacy."

"Understood. Thank you, auror," Wendell had replied. He had what he needed, anyway.</pre>

<pre>"I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION!" Fudge shouted once more, tired of being ignored.

"Do you see that, Minister?" Harry asked pointing to what was left of Voldemort. Then he continued: "That is what is left of Lord Voldemort. And all of them saw him here and they also saw me fighting him and blowing him into pieces." Then he turned to the rest of adults and teens and asked with a smile, "Because you saw that, right?"

"Yes, we did!" Everyone said at the same time. The worst thing that could happen to them if they lied in court would be a fine. But if the messed with Harry, they would be dead! The choice was very simple about what to do in that case!

"And all of them were death eaters," Harry continued telling Fudge, pointing to the bodies. He continued, as Fudge was very pale now, "A lot of them were seen by you as friends or were ministry workers that were close to you. That, Minister, makes you an associate of them and also death eater."

"I'M NOT A DEATH EATER!" Fudge shouted furious.

"Of course, you are not, Minister. You don't have brains to be one," Harry said with a smile.</pre>

<pre>After everyone at the Burrow at that time assembled around the kitchen table, demanding to know what the twins thought they were doing calling a meeting, George brandished the letter from Harry.

"We have, here, a missive most massive," he declared.

"A note most notable," added Fred.

"Written by the personal hand of..."

"Lord Harrison James Potter of..."

"The Noble and Most Ancient House of Potter!"

"What?" asked Molly, quickly wiping her hands clean of baking flour.

"I thought we were clear," said George.

"It's from Harry," said Fred.

Molly immediately rounded the table and plucked it from George's fingers.

"Hey!" they chorused in indignation.

However, before she even had a chance to read it, the whole text immediately blurred until it was illegible.

"It has a secrecy charm on it," she grumbled, thrusting it back into George's hands. "You're going to need to read it to me."

"That was our plan," said George.

"Until you snatched it away," said Fred.

"Don't be rude!" she snapped back. "Now, read it to me!"

The two glanced at each other with both thinking, 'And she calls us rude?'</pre>

<pre>Lord Voldemort was savoring every second of his rebirth, from regrowing Crouch's hand, to humiliating Lucius and the others begging for his forgiveness, to simply breathing and standing as a man once again.

A gesture from his wand released the boy. "Though I hear you haven't been properly instructed in the art of dueling, I will give you a chance to face me boy. Go ahead and take your wand. Killing you without it doesn't seem sporting and it is time to correct history's mistake!"

The pathetic boy picked up the wand and grabbed the he tiny leather pouch next to it. The Dark Lord gestured to a clear area where he intended to finish the boy.

Instead, the insipid child broke into a sprint and dived behind a mausoleum!

***

Harry didn't have much time. He realized that the contents of Luna's bag were the "Moon's gifts."

Dumping everything out of the magical moleskin pouch on the ground, he saw his horntail model from the first task, the egg from the second, her butterbeer cork earplugs, a block of cheese, six gobstones, two issues of the Quibbler, five socks that were all different colors, his pen knife she'd borrowed the first week of school and said she'd returned, and several pieces of macaroni art.

There was one spell Harry truly excelled at. A masked Death Eater apparated a few feet away from Harry as he cast the engorgement charm on that tiny dragon model. It swelled up to the size of his godfather's Animagus form and leaped on the man slashing with its claws and biting him.

Harry wasted no time inserting the corks into his ear canals. He felt the earth tremble as a portion of the tomb he was using for shelter was obliterated. A second Death Eater appeared and "discovered" his toy dragon. The rest of the tomb simply vanished and Harry was looking at an angry Lord Voldemort and the rest of his Death Eaters.

His enemy was saying something, but Harry cracked open the egg and cast the Sonorous charm. Even with Luna's enchanted hearing protection some of the noise got through. It was painful, but nowhere near what the others were experiencing. They collapsed to the ground. A few had the sense of mind to apparate away. Pettigrew's ghost was dislodged from the witch. Harry struggled to his own feet and moved away from the painful wail.

Voldemort reappeared as Harry ran to the fallen witch. Harry thought he was going to die before he could find the Portkey, but it was Voldemort collapsing in agony. Harry looked around and saw his toy dragon badly injuring a massive snake. It occurred to Harry that Tom Riddle might have a connection to the monster.

Finding the necklace, he wrapped his arms around the witch and felt the pull on the middle of his body.

***

Harry faithfully relayed his story to Dumbledore and several others in the infirmary finishing with a feeble attempt at humor, "I guess, technically, they're Deaf Eaters now."

"Preposterous!" Minister Fudge exclaimed. "The boy is known for telling fanciful tales."

+

"What did you do to my quill?" Delores Umbridge exclaimed.

Harry cringed. "Nothing, ma'am. It just snapped in half when I stated writing."

"Give me that! What happened to the back of your hand?"

"I was practicing transfiguration with the Headmaster last night and I managed to turn this section to stone. He said if it doesn't wear off by my next lesson, he'll teach me how to reverse it."

"Do you have any idea how expensive that quill was?"

Harry didn't. It looked like Mr. Lockhart's special contracts quill that Harry still had. He wasn't about to offer it up as a replacement either. It was somewhat painful when writing with it and Harry didn't care for the idea of doing lines with it. There was no doubt why Hermione Granger smelled like ointment and looked pale the other day.

Madame Umbridge raged, "Willfully destroying a Professor's property! Ten more points from Ravenclaw and two detentions!"

The door creaked open and Dumbledore walked in. "My apologies Delores, I was wandering the halls and heard the commotion. Is something the matter?"

"No, of course not Headmaster," Madame Umbridge immediately shifted her tone. "Potter broke a quill I had given him … nothing more."

"Well, my specialty is Alchemy, but I am a serviceable enchanter. Perhaps I could repair it for you?"

"No, no, no. That's quite alright, Headmaster." Umbridge's wand came out and vanished the broken quill.

"But you seemed rather distraught at the loss of that expensive quill," Dumbledore said. "If Harry did indeed break it – willfully I might add – I can authorize a punitive draft from his vault to pay for a replacement. Just tell me what type of quill it was and I'll make the arrangements this evening."

Taken aback, Umbridge answered, "It really was just an heirloom, given to me by a good friend, that's why I overreacted."

"Indeed," Dumbledore said, while stroking his long beard. "In that case, Delores, I would recommend that, in the future, you not entrust a precious heirloom to the only partially-trained hands of a student. I'd hate to see a repeat of this unfortunate incident again. As Headmaster, I'll allow the point deduction to stand, but I cannot go along with awarding two detentions for the breaking of a quill. It seems a tad excessive. In fact, since Harry's overweighted hand is my fault; I feel the need to correct this."

From his robes, he produced a phoenix feather and presented it to Madame Umbridge. "I can only hope that one of Fawkes' feathers can replace that which you have lost. All I ask is that you never mention this to Fawkes. My familiar tends to get peeved when I give pieces of its body away without prior consultation. It sings a pleasant little tune when the words are written with good intentions behind them. I trust it will serve you well."

Turning, Dumbledore winked at Harry and confidently walked from the room.</pre>

<pre>Outside was more pleasant than the noisy crush. Warming charms had awakened flowers four months early. Insects were also awakened. Colin flicked a beetle off of Harri's shoulder. The beetle went right into Snape's mouth when he popped out from behind a bush, doubtlessly to take points from Gryffindor. Two seconds later, Snape's head was ripped apart and Rita Skeeter appeared out of nowhere, cut in half.

+

The talk had been both frightening and enlightening. It wasn't just a talk. The Talk. Harri and Colin had been found, half-clothed, shortly after classes resumed. Neither of them had a clue what they were doing but they were well on the way to figuring it out.

Sirius had bagged, claiming lack of appropriate knowledge, the inappropriateness of an extremely studly man talking with a young girl, and a very overdue dental appointment. Pomfrey had bagged, claiming she had no materials to give a boy-turned-girl and that it wasn't her job, anyway. McGonagall of course didn't tell Harry anything. In fact, she expressly forbade Hermione from telling Harry anything, saying that some secrets of womanhood are not to be discussed with men or boys, ever. When Harry pointed out that she was a girl and had been for over two months and probably would be for the rest of her life, McGonagall gave her a detention for arguing with a teacher. McGonagall really needed to pull the stick out of her ass. Or put one in. Whatever worked.

+

When the task started, the other three jumped into the water, charms and transfigurations showing their strategies. Harri just slapped her hand on the water a few times and yelled, "Hey, Giant Squid! I've got a job for you. Really good pay, easy work!" When the sea monster came close, Harri explained her offer. The squid's eyes popped wide and then it was off like a shot.

In just minutes all four hostages were carefully placed on the dock and the squid was eagerly waving all eight arms and two tentacles at Harri. Ten transfigurations later and the tentacle monster was off again.

The one-hour deadline came. The deadline went. The other three champions didn't come, but the Giant Tentacle Monster did, many times. It – no, he, multiply and gigantically he – waved the three in the air near the dock. The judges all went down to investigate, then they were all dragged into the water. Harri kept well back. No sense in tempting the monster.

After another hour, the three champions and the five judges were tossed onto the dock. All were badly disheveled and of them all, only Dumbledore wasn't horrified and weeping. Maybe he viewed it as an important introduction to a new species. Maybe.

...ooo000ooo...

A boom signified the start of the third task. The other three champions, replacements for the disabled original three, had been allowed to start at the same time as Harri because of the confusion of the second task. No clear winner was identifiable, except for Harri, and she was being punished because the squid had managed to get some.

+

As the other three champions took off running, Harri conjured a series of large, thin metal disks and arranged them in a ring around her. She then cast a silence spell on herself.

She would have warned Colin what was about to happen. But she was annoyed with him this evening. That didn't go there!

With a grin of pure mischief, Harri cast her last spell of the evening. All of the disks started vibrating at the exact same frequency: 92 cents below the lowest octave of E-flat.

With a mass groan, all of the spectators shit themselves at the same time. Minister of Magic Fudge – and if that name wasn't a harbinger of doom, then Harri had never taken a Divination class – was a politician. He was full of shit. Once it had all left his body, there wasn't enough body left to sustain life. "Oh my God, she killed Corny!" someone yelled. "You bastard!"

The Brown Noise, a dreadful secret found in the Black Library — or should that be the Brown Library? — had been used over the centuries to discredit opponents in political debates and to win duels. This was the first time it had been broadcast over the Wizarding Wireless Network. Sirius was impressed that Harri had managed to make all of Wizarding Britain shit themselves at the same time.

Except for Harri herself. She'd protected herself from the Brown Noise. She'd put up shields to keep away any splatter. She'd gotten away with it clean.

Then the smell hit.

+

The usual parliament of owls fluttered in at breakfast a few mornings after the third task. It was a week before the end of the school year.

Harri watched the owls with more interest than usual. She wasn't expecting any deliveries today, but the owls were the timing cue for another event. Trying not to make it obvious, she watched the entrance to the Great Hall.

And right on schedule a delivery man walked in. Harri had had to arrange for special delivery because owls directed to the staff were rerouted and did not make their deliveries in front of the student body. She thought it was worth the trouble and expense because McGonagall had really pissed her off: three-hour detentions every night for the rest of the year and for the first three months of the next school year, just because the crone had soiled herself at the tournament. Well, she was one of the people who had forced Harri to participate. When Harri appealed the detentions to Dumbledore, on the grounds that her method for completing the tournament was not subject to review or criticism by staff members not involved in the tournament, the old wizard simply mumbled something about "has my full confidence" and "ruined a very nice new robe".

"Professor McGonagall! Professor McGonagall! Got a special delivery for Professor McGonagall! Here you go, Madame. Your first delivery from Dildo-a-Day. 'Tools for what ails you' (registered trademark). If you'll just sign on the dotted line to confirm receipt?"

McGonagall signed, looking puzzled. The flamboyantly dressed wizard managed to escape from the Great Hall before she had opened the package. She was shocked speechless as she held up the realistically shaped, realistically colored, and realistically textured "relaxation tool". The gales of laughter from the students knocked her out of the shock and she started flinging detentions around like confetti. Harri managed to escape detention by hiding behind a larger student.

The next morning, McGonagall drove the delivery wizard out of the hall before he could get to the head table. He was a competent professional, however, and managed to launch the day's delivery so that it landed in her tea. Pointing upward at her. Many detentions were handed out that day, too.

The third morning, a little old lady hobbled up to the head table during breakfast and told McGonagall she had an important message for her. Leaning in, she gestured for the professor to bring her head closer. "Special delivery!" she hollered in McGonagall's ear as she thwapped the teacher in the forehead with a realistically shaped but unrealistically colored model. Cackling, she ran away, transforming back into the delivery wizard just before reaching the doors.

The fourth morning, there was no delivery wizard and no little old lady. There was, however, the delivery owl for the daily Prophet. The doll had a little trouble this morning, likely because its load was heavier than usual. The day's "tool for what ails you" was a bright green, nicely matching the headmaster's garish robes.

The fifth morning, McGonagall did not show up for breakfast. In her first class of the day, which just happened to include the Gryffindor fourth years, a female prefect interrupted the class to tell the professor there was an urgent letter for her. As soon as McGonagall broke the wax seal, the transfiguration ended and the students all saw her holding a three-pronged, purple tool.

The sixth morning, McGonagall skipped both breakfast and class, choosing instead to hide in her apartment. No one was sure how the delivery had been managed, but the result was that the old woman burst screaming from her rooms, followed by a clear model bouncing along after her like a pogo stick.

The seventh morning, the last breakfast before the students went home, the delivery wizard returned. "I was so sad to hear that Professor McGonagall had to be admitted to St Mungo's," he confidentially said to Dumbledore, whispering low enough that students in the far corner of the Great Hall had to strain to hear. "It's not unheard of when people over-use our products. She should have read the instructions which suggested twelve times a day as a reasonable limit. Well, nothing for it now. I'll just leave this here for when she returns."

Arranging for special delivery had been very expensive, but worth every knut.</pre>

<pre>Albus (etc) Dumbledore was having yet another Bad Day. Dolores Umbitch – he had taken a liking to the human toad's nickname used by the students – was again on the warpath against him and it was getting on his nerves.

Then, Harry Potter was out of sight again, missing dinner. Those habits of hiding with something to learn he had picked from the Late Know-it-All was also getting on his nerves.

He was so deep in his brooding that he missed the warning the Castle sent from the disturbance in the wards, and he was thinking over his plans for the future when a commotion was heard from outside the Great Hall. He was just standing up when the doors were pushed open and a bloody Caretaker thrown in front of the Staff Table. The cries of surprise of the assembled students were cut short when people wearing dark robes and well-feared masks entered and took place on the sides of the doors, while a single character was making a great entrance.

"Dumbledore, my old friend!"

"I was not expecting your visit Tom."

"Of course not, Headmaster." replied Voldemort in a dismissive voice. "After all, you very well know I've little interest in you, so I'll get to the point. You know, I've been told that to be an efficient villain, one should not waste time gloating and explaining how a genius he is in his evil plans." Then, he surveyed the students frozen at their seats – even Ron Weasley had stopped eating, for the show of a Dark Lord trying to joke was utterly terrifying.

"Where the fuck is Harry Potter?"

"Language, Tom." said Dumbledore in a benevolent voice, having a hard time finding a way to get out of this mess. Duelling Voldemort in the crowded Great Hall was the mother of bad ideas, and by the way, where was the brat? And what was this noise outside? Something sounding like fireworks?

"Tom Marvolo Riddle, Son of Merope!"

Everybody jumped in their seats, and even the Dark Lord was startled by the booming voice. The puzzlement increased when it became obvious that this voice belonged to a young girl, who was glaring at the allegedly most feared wizard around. Dumbledore cocked his head, trying to remember her name, but his deputy beat him.

"Miss Darbishire!"

"Please stay out of this, Professor, this is a family issue I wish to settle with my...uncle." she said with an overplayed distaste.

While everyone was stunned by the declaration – Darbishire is You Know Who's niece?, Dumbledore had noticed Harry Potter standing behind her, fingering his wand, looking amused. It was time to act, give Tom a chance to kill the Horcrux within Harry! He raised his wand and...

"Expelliarmus!"

Severus Snape had seen the Headmaster's gesture and was contemplating a facepalm when, to his surprise, the wand soared across the hall towards the outstretched hand of a young woman, in her twenties, with a dramatic likeness with the late Hermione Granger, only significantly hotter,in a military styled outfit. He saw her shudder when grabbing the handle, then blink, before her face broke into a huge grin.

"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, old scoundrel! So you had it!" then she stopped. "Harry, didn't he tell you he had your father's cloak to study it?"

Harry rose an eyebrow.

"You are an ugly twisted son of a bitch, you know that? The Potter's lives could have been saved by the cloak, but you were more interested in playing with the Hallows, weren't you?"

"Hem hem"

Everyone turned towards Voldemort who was growing upset with this had not planned his return in such a ridiculous show, and it was spiralling out of control. And what was this noise outside?

"Mulciber! Go and see what's happeningoutside and make it stop!"

The Death Eater walked out of the Hall, but as soon as he has passed the doors, his head disappeared in a bloody mist.

"What the..."

Anna's voice rose again: "Tom Marvolo Riddle!"

"What!"

The Dark Lord spun once again to face the annoying teen and decided to make an example out of her attitude.

"Avada Kedavra!" He had not finished the incantation that he knew that something was amiss. The curse was underpowered and she just sidestepped it, while Potter – dammit, what was it with this brat and the Killing Curse – casually whipped a dagger and absorbed it.

"This is it, Tom Marvolo Riddle. You have sullied and disgraced the name of Salazar Slytherin for far too long. You have spouted nonsense and shamedthe family with narrow minded and bloodthirsty behaviour, and I call upon Magic to judge your unworthiness in belonging to the realm of the Founders Lines."

Silence fell on the crowd. Dumbledore felt a shift in the Castle wards. The girl was invoking the Old Laws: it required three people related to the Founders to enforce them. Harry was one of them, but he was not aware of this inheritance, was he? And what about the third?

His first question was immediately answered when Harry stepped forward:

"I, Harry James Potter, second the request, as Heir of the Gryffindor bloodline." A brief golden glow surrounded him and it felt like the Castle's magic.

"I, Hermione Jane Granger, in the stead of Ravenclaw, support the request." A brief but strong blue glow.

Dumbledore shook his head, to try and wake out of this bad dream, but for naught. And now, there was movement at the Gryffindor table.

"I, Neville Franck Longbottom, act proxy for the House of Hufflepuff, and support the request." Another strong glow. Neville stepped forward, and smiled.

"Welcome back Hermione."

Hermione nodded with a smile.

Anna stepped forward and raised her wand, trying to clear her mind and focus on the connection she could feel to the castle. The three others felt compelled to do the same and they felt the Castle's magic flowing through them and gathering around Voldemort, probing him, and the Dark Lord frown, annoyed at first, then concerned. Fear adorned his snake like features and soon, panic, when he had to drop his now burning wand.

"My Lord!" yelled Bellatrix Lestrange, launching herself towards the group with a curse on her lips.

Unfortunately for the Dark Lord's Lieutenant, she targeted Hermione and Dumbledore saw a woman step from the group of armed people who had gathered outside the hall, and yell "Don't touch my daughter, you bitch" before lodging a couple bullets in her chest. Voldemort barely noticed, for he was falling on his knees in great pain. The Founder's heirs lowered their wands.

"Thanks, Merlin"

Many looked at the Potions Teacher, who was slumped into his chair, his left sleeve pulled up, his Dark Mark fading away.

"That was rather anticlimactic." stated Harry.

Hermione scowled.

"You've got an unfinished job here, sweetheart," she said, taking his hand in hers.

"Yeah," he whispered, sliding his wand in his wrist holster.

"Tom Marvolo Riddle, son of Merope Gaunt, today ends the feud between our lines." he claimed, unsheathing the Dagger. Anna signalled him, mouthing "blood price". He nodded, adding: "For you paid the price in Magic and Blood." The former Dark Lord eyes widened and the Dagger almost flew by itself straight into his heart.

There was a long silence, and then a cheer rose from Gryffindor table where the Weasley twins were putting on a show. Harry whipped his wand and petrified them.

"George and Frederick Weasley, your behaviour since you set foot in this place was a shame. Under the facade of jokesters, you are nothing but sadists and greedy bullies, and I despise bullies more than Dark Lords. I was weak and naïve to lend you a thousand Galleons and let you have your way with them. This will be dealt by the Goblins, since I do not want to be associated with the both you whatsoever. For I was always welcomed by your family, and discarding the appalling behaviour of your younger brother, I will not declare a feud against the Weasleys"

"Harry, my boy..."

"Don't 'my boy' me Headmaster." cut Harry "You've been useless in this story. You gambled in a way that condemned me to sacrifice, but I could as well have joined Voldemort. I could have joined Voldemort if nothing had been left to me to fight for. I could have joined Voldemort if you had managed to take the woman I love from me. Ironic, no? I do remember the talk you gave me on the ability to love as my strength, and yet you tried to take Hermione from me. Fortunately, she was far stronger than you thought, and it's her love that saved us all."

He shook his head sadly, made a wide gesture to the Great Hall. "This place was the only place I remember feeling like home, and you took this from me this year."

He walked away, towards Gryffindor Tower.

"Miss Granger!" said Dumbledore genially "I'm so glad the news of your death was unfounded."

Hermione faked bewilderment. She looked at Anna, then at Neville, and said in a stage whisper : "He's worse than I remembered. Don't you Brits have retirement plans or shit? That would come handy for him..."

Neville shrugged.

"I thought so. And by the way, Headmaster, it's Special Agent Wilkins to you. Even if Magic has a thing for my former self, the Hermione Granger you knew is long gone, since your little trick last year. "

+

It took quite some time for Harry to get a grasp on the situation. He was lying in a bed. A real bed, not a overly fluffy thing draped with heavy curtains. There was an orange cat purring near his feet. He almost cried with relief and cuddled against Hermione who was sleeping deeply.

When he woke up again, the sun was away from the bed. Hermione was facing him, awake.

"Good morning, Harry." she said with a peck on his lips.

"Good morning, Hermione. Well, I hope it is still morning"

"Yes, thanks to the Time Zones"

They enjoyed staying in each other's arms, then Hermione began to chuckle.

"What's funny?"

"Had you figured that Dumbledore's wand was the Elder Wand?"

"The Hallow?"

She nodded. "I realised when I disarmed him and caught the wand."

"So you are now the Master of the Elder Wand?"

She shook her head and replied: "I left the Great Hall playing with it, and my father stole it."

"And?"

Hermione chuckled again.

"Merlin'sPants. Is your father the True Master of the Elder Wand?"

She nodded.

"But he's a muggle!"

She nodded again.

"Can it work? I mean, it is supposed to choose a wizard? So if there's no magic in the wand's owner...what happened?"

"As far as I can tell, the wand core drained itself trying to connect with dad's. The Death Stick is just that, a harmless piece of wood."

Harry tightened his grip on Hermione's waist. They stayed this way for what seemed to be hours, without a word, contemplating the mere idea of a future. For once, he was allowed to think about a future, like an open sky, and he loved flying.

All would be well.</pre>

<pre>At least. Harry dived, while Malfoy was waiting, not eager to fall victim of a Wronski Feint. But it wasn't. A couple steep turns, a quick climb and Harry's hand closed on the winged ball. Thanks Merlin.

And then he barely felt it, a sort of whooshing sound, instinctively barrelling to avoid a late Bludger. Shit, this one would have hurt. He landed close to his team, minus Ron who was still up in front of his hoops. Close to Malfoy, too, who limped towards him.

"Saved Weasley's neck, haven't you?' he said to Harry. "I've never seen a worse Keeper…"

"Yeah, me neither." Cut in Harry, before Malfoy could voice his next insult. "Well, since you're the worst Seeker in school, it balances things, doesn't it? Fair game"

And Harry turned his back to Malfoy.

/

"You were McGonagall's pet, Granger" said Draco, seemingly out of his initial shock. "You're too much of a goody-two-shoes to act after your boasting, you stupid Gryffindor."

Hermione nodded sadly. She pointed her wand towards the Disposable Death Eater bound in the corner of the room.

"Avada Kedavra!"

A Flash of green, and this feeling of an inexistent wind blowing something away.

"I" she stated, "for one, am on par with my Unforgivables, Malfoy".

"You are crazy!"

"Draco! Control yourself." scolded the father, while the son was on the verge of hysterics.

Hermione smiled. "Are you complimenting me, Draco dear? To you, I will confess my secret ambition: I plan to be the light side counterpart to Bellatrix Lestrange, yoursweet auntie. Oh, yes, you barely know her, she's been vacationing in Azkaban for most of your life…" she said, drawing imaginary quotes around light side with her fingers. A flick of her wand and Draco's trousers vanished. She observed the scars around his knee.

"You know that this wound looks like it was made by a bullet?" she looked at Lucius Malfoy. "I suppose you're not aware that my father is a former sniper in Her Majesty's Special Forces? Shooting people where it hurts most to incapacitate them was a great part of his job. Or killing them."

As realization was downing on the elder Malfoy's face, she pulled her handgun from its holster.

"I wonder if I could chop your manly bits off with a single bullet without killing you, Draco?" she asked, looking at his father in the eye. "Sounds fun."

She paused, before adding.

"Unless your father has some interesting tales to tell to distract me…"

"You really think I'm going to fall for this old trick, you pathetic bint?"

Hermione stopped to look at Lucius Malfoy in the eye.

"Oooh…" she cooed "That's a big manly retort, Lucius dear". She pointed her wand towards the youngest Malfoy. "Care to elaborate?"

"Go to hell!"

"Been there, done that." she stated, and without a pause, without a glance: "Crucio!"

She just held the spell on Draco Malfoy for a couple seconds, enough for a liquid pool to spread under his shaking body.

"Geez, did your son just piss and shit himself? Honestly, Lucius, I thought you'd better trained him. I mean, even a Half-bloodlike Potter handled Voldemort's Cruciatus better than that. I'm deeply disappointed…"

She walked back a couple steps, considering the show. "I guess I could refresh my Imperius by making him clean up his mess bare-handed?" She tapped her wand on her chin, pensively. "No. To weak, not worth it." She nodded to Doherty who quickly made Draco Malfoy presentable before portkeying him away.

"Now, before I leave you in the very capable hands of Central Intelligence Travel for an all inclusive stay on the Alcatraz Resort, Is there any bargainingmaterial you'd like to use, Lucius Dear? Because once in the Agency's holding cell, you will be stripped naked, body and soul. Whatever your Occlumency skills, you won't hold long in front of a dozen Legilimens and all those fancy drugs they like to use. This is your last chance to be cooperative and maybe, save something. So?"</pre>

<pre>"I just can't believe it, Harry," Hermione shook her head. "I've read all about them, and the things they've done, and it's horrifying! I can hardly stand being near them."

"They're just misunderstood!" Harry urged eagerly. "Think about it! I bet you would be upset too if everyone tried to avoid you, and then locked you up on an island with a bunch of criminals."

Hermione stared at him, shocked. "You... you're right!" she said, horrified. "Oh, those poor things! I bet no-one's ever shown them any love!"

"I knew you'd understand," Harry smiled at her. "Most people think I'm just crazy, you know."

And so, the Society for the Promotion of Understanding of Dementors (or SPUD for short) was born.

"So what was this unbeatable way of sneaking into Diagon Alley you had?" Sirius wanted to know.

"Here," Harry handed Sirius his glasses. "Put these on."

Sirius did so. "Whoa... Wait, Harry, why am I glowing? And why do you have a purple aura around you?"

"Do I?" Harry looked vaguely interested. "Those aren't normal glasses. Luna got them for me– I'm not sure what the enchantments do, exactly, but the glowing is just the Wrackspurts in your head. I'll have to ask Luna what the purple means."

Sirius wisely decided to keep silent.

3 September 1993

Diagon Alley

"Good heavens!" a portly witch screamed, dropping her shopping bags in horror. "It's Sirius Black! And Harry Potter!"

"Harry Potter? Where?" Harry looked around frantically. "I don't see him anywhere!"

"Oh," the witch flushed in embarrassment. "For a second I thought... you look just like him!"

"Nonsense," Harry said pompously. "Harry Potter wears glasses. I don't have any glasses on, so obviously I'm not Harry Potter."

"Exactly," Sirius said from beside him. "See, I may look like Sirius Black from a distance, but Sirius Black doesn't wear glasses, does he? Since I'm wearing glasses, I'm obviously not Sirius Black."

"Of course, of course," the witch said quickly. "I'm so sorry, gentlemen! I don't know what came over me to make such a silly mistake."

She bustled away.

"...You mean it's really that easy?" Sirius asked, aghast. "Really?"

"Most wizards haven't an ounce of common sense," Harry paraphrased what Hermione had said at the end of their first year. "Now come on, the goblins won't be so easy to fool, but they also don't care about silly things like escaped convicts on the run."</pre>

<pre>Michael Frobisher, senior Auror, pushed up the glasses on his nose as he entered. He glanced nervously at the decor of Dawlish's old office, as though he expected someone to jump out at him. "Councillor Malfoy. What can I do for you?"

"Frobisher, I called you in here because we share a problem. And I am desperately trying to find a way to fix it." He looked over his papers. "As of today, we have over forty aurors killed - four killed as Potter escaped Britain, twenty-one at Hogsmeade, and at least twenty killed in the days to follow."

Malfoy swallowed. "Unfortunately, that is only part of the problem. We have received twenty resignations in the past two weeks. And that's the ones we know about; the reason I state 'at least twenty' is that many aurors - over thirty - can't be found. We don't know if they've been killed or if they've run." He sighed. "All totaled, over a quarter of our auror corps is gone."

Frobisher nodded slowly. "Councillor Malfoy, may I be allowed to speak freely, as long as what I say does not pass beyond the Council and our Lord?"

Malfoy nodded slowly. "What is it that concerns you?"

Frobisher sighed. "Councillor... I don't know how long the aurors can remain an effective fighting force - or even if they are."

Malfoy's eyes widened. "What do you mean?"

Frobisher bit his lip. "Many of us are terrified, sir. Absolutely terrified. Most of the aurors are ready to run; if this keeps up any longer, we may not have an auror force anymore." Malfoy blinked as Frobisher growled. "That bastard Potter hasn't just targeted us, sir. If what you say is true, we killed his family - and he's doing his damnedest to return the favor." He grimaced. "If it were just our lives, we wouldn't be caring so much. It's part of the job description. But we never asked for our wives and kids to be involved in this. The only ones who haven't talked about taking a runner are those who aren't married, who don't have families to worry about."</pre>

<pre>Fudge nearly wept with relief when they told him their terms and he immediately signed his agreement. In exchange for the rest of the week off, thirty thousand galleons in scrip each, and the promise of receiving hard currency at some point in the future. They agreed not to burn the Ministry to the ground and hang the Minister from the nearest light pole, it was an agreement thought fair by the majority of the participants.

IIIIIIIIII

The Branch Manager smiled as he saw the line form in front of the accounts receivable desk. He'd never doubted for a minute that his plan would work.

At the front of the line stood Arthur Weasley, ready to take on the debt that had impoverished generations of his family.

"And how much would you like to pay this month?" the Goblin asked with an oily grin.

"All of it," Arthur said proudly.

"But the interest payments alone."

"Should more then cover the rest of it," Arthur interjected, "three years right?"

"Fine," the goblin sighed. They'd never expected the humans to scrape up enough gold to pay it all off.

"Here you are," Arthur said as he slid a pile of scrip across the table, "I even included a bit extra for you."

"What is this?" the goblin asked sickly.

"My family debts," Arthur replied with a feral grin, "take it. Just as good as gold you know."

The Branch Manager's world collapsed when he saw how the humans were paying their debts. They weren't supposed to do that, they weren't supposed to be able to do that. Hell, there wasn't even supposed to be that much paper in existence, only enough to cover the Ministry's pay roll.</pre>

<pre>It was a chilly day, overcast and threatening to drop things from the sky.

Ron had his broom and was going out to the quidditch pitch for some flying, when he spotted a pack of Slytherin girls running around the lake. He definitely noticed their physical attributes, but the girl stopped him dead in his tracks.

She was wearing an orange Chudley Cannons shirt.

Slimy snake, or no, he was in love.

He had suddenly found another interest other than quidditch and eating.

Making note of who she was for further reference, he trudged on to the quidditch pitch, little hearts flashing in his eyes.</pre>

<pre>After about a half an hour basking in the light feeling his head held, he got up and went to the castle, ready to face the consequences of his wish. He made it to the Gryffindor common room unmolested. When he got there he was overtaken by his ex-friend, Ron Weasley; a tall, gangly redhead, who was brandishing a letter.

"Look what I've got," the redhead said smugly. "I finally made it rich. This is a letter telling me I've won a sweepstake." Then the boy rubbed his nose and got a confused look on his face. "I don't remember entering, but I won. So now I am the Boy Who Won… prefer it to your title." He pushed his former friend in the shoulder, gloating on his new found fame.

"Good for you," Harry deadpanned. Then shoved the taller boy out of his way and headed to his bed. He was suddenly tired and wanted to put the day behind him, including the bragging Weasley.

"Jealous?" Ron taunted. "Can't share the glory?"

"I sure hope your fame brings you everything it ever brought me," Harry said over his shoulder as he walked up the stairs. He just made it to his bed and flopped down, not even undressing, and was quickly asleep.

The next day more and more students were saying 'hi' to him and clapping him on the back stating they believed in him. It was at lunch when a huge flock of owls descended on the Hall, all of them had a copy of the Quibbler, with the headline 'Harry Potter Tells All' splashed across the front. Harry took his copy and had to admit, after he read the front page article, that it was well done. The only thing he regretted was that he was still dubbed the Boy Who Lived, but at least now people would admire him for what he had done and not some fluke.

Ron scowled at him; angry that Harry was getting the attention once more, until a copy of the Daily Prophet was also distributed and the story of his winning were published within. He didn't seem to notice that his family was glaring at him.

"Oi, Potter, how does it feel to be second best? You had to get your story heard in a second rate paper, while I made the front page of the Prophet," Ron yelled above the crowd around him.

"Feels pretty damn good," Harry said with a real smile.

"Whatever," Ron scoffed, turning back to the students gathered around him. All congratulating him and asking him how he cheated. His twin brothers being the loudest to ask that question. "What? I didn't even enter let alone cheat!" he yelled, red-faced.</pre>

<pre>"Mr. Potter, Ms. Lovegood…" McGonagall began sternly.
"Mrs. Potter." Luna corrected dreamily.

"Ms. Lovegood," She continued, "We need you to explain your behavior this morning. Never in all my years at this school have we found a young man in a young lady's bed."

"I would think it would be quite common." Harry replied offhandedly.

"Oh we catch the opposite all the time, but that isn't the point. Such behavior is not what we have come to expect from Gryffindor House."

"No, you'd think it was more the Slytherin job, they are supposed to be sneaky, but then you remember that no one outside their house would date them." Luna shot in.

"Ms. Lovegood!" Flitwick gasped.

"Love very good!" Harry said fondly.

"It's Mrs. Potter!" Luna huffed. "You've been married to me how long and you still make jokes about my maiden name?"

"Excuse me, we are supposed to be talking about how we are going to keep you two out of each others beds." Professor McGonagall wouldn't be distracted.

"Oh I quite welcome the challenge. I think it will be interesting to see what you come up with." Harry said. "What are your current methods? I might have a few ideas."

"Well there is a gender line at the bottom of the stair case. The standard anti-apperation and portkey wards all over the castle. There is a second gender line across the threshold of the room. We've never needed more than that."

"Hmm… Well I do have a few ideas. Can your gender lines be fooled by a metamorph? And what about the exceptions built into those gender lines? Perhaps you ought to tweak those. Additionally, look at the portkey wards. The Headmaster can make portkeys that work on the grounds and castle. If I somehow forced Dumbledore to give me a portkey, I could pop into any of the girls' dorms. Never overlook the human element in your calculations."

/

"Mr. Potter! What is the meaning of this?"

"What's that Professor McGonagall?"

"Why are you not wearing any pants?" She screeched.

"Oh, well that's easy. The dress code says I need to wear my robe, a tie, have my shirt buttoned all the way up, and tucked in. It says nothing about pants or lack thereof. I was feeling warm this morning so I just tucked my shirt into my shorts and grabbed my robes."

"Pants are most definitely necessary! I'm going to go make that correction now. I swear, your father and godfather would be proud of you right now."

"No they wouldn't. They'd be spinning in their graves." Fletcher commented as he passed.

"You'd do well to remember that can be arranged Old Man."

/

There was a mild compulsion charm placed on the doorways leading into the Great Hall that Friday. The strong willed never noticed, but the rest seemed like they were waiting for something. Dumbledore entered the Great Hall halfway through breakfast and walked up the center aisle.
When he was halfway to the head table, Harry stood and shouted, "Hail the Light Lord Dumbles!"

About three quarters of the great hall jumped to their feet and roared, "Hail Ceaser! Long may he reign."

The compulsion charms and cheering continued every few days until they were no longer needed as everyone jumped and hailed Dumbledore without prompting first thing in the morning. Psychological conditioning and group psychology were wonderful things.

/

Christmas was calm and enjoyed by all, though Hermione never stopped asking questions. Luna retaliated by enchanting an empty collar to follow Hermione around then announcing that one of her snorkacks liked her. It was quite humorous to watch Hermione squeal and run away.
As time passed, the Freak Parade grew in popularity for a variety of reasons. It seems a lot of people had the capabilities to make their own spells, or even had a few family secrets, but wouldn't share them for fear of having them turned against them. A second version of the little black books came out that was self updating and allowed people to submit new spells protected by the same oaths not to use them to harm others and not to share them.
Within ten years seventy five percent of the magical innovations stayed within the Freak community. Store owners in the group began offering discounts to other members. Purple and green became popular fashion. Slytherin became known as the party House.

Ok, we were lying about the last one.

When Luna turned thirty five officially (rather than her personal timeline), there was a vote of no confidence in the Wizengamot. She was elected Minister of Magic in a landslide victory. It was the cleanest political coup in history, all made possible because she coerced young Mr. Potter to the Purple side.</pre>

<pre>Harry was later summoned to the Headmaster’s office, whereupon he was faced with McGonagall, Snape and Dumbledore.

“Harry, Harry, it’s good to see you. Are you well and keeping up with your studies?”

“Yes, thank you,” Harry replied, rather suspicious as to why he was there.

“An excellent defeat of young Draco in duelling club I must say.” Harry kept silent. “And impressive skills subduing the snake. But I’m afraid I must tell you that you cannot keep it.”

“Her,” Harry interrupted. “She’s female.” Snape’s mouth twitched.

“Ah yes, very good,” Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. “But my point still stands. She’s not on the list of permitted pets and so I’m afraid she must go.”

“Ding,” Harry said. Dumbledore fell silent and frowned at him. “That’s my bullshit detector,” Harry explained, and McGonagall gasped. “Ron has a rat, Lee has a tarantula, and therefore I can only conclude that the reason you don’t want me keeping a snake is because it’s a snake, and thus has ominous connotations with Slytherin and everything ‘evil.” Snape’s mouth twitched again.

“Frankly, I suspect that snakes once were on the permitted pets list. A cat for Gryffindors, an owl for Ravenclaws and a toad for Hufflepuffs, and therefore snakes for Slytherin.” Dumbledore blinked.

“Five points from Gryffindor for your cheek, Potter,” Snape snapped. Harry rather felt that it was because the man was jealous that he couldn’t call Dumbledore out on his bullshit, being employed by him and all.

“Be that as it may, your snake is an Eastern Brown Snake, one of the most venomous in the world, and potentially a danger to students.”

“Ding,” Harry said again, once more shocking the adults judging by their shocked expressions. “Lee’s tarantula is venomous, and I haven’t heard a word of complaint against it. And Lee can’t even communicate with it. Baneofallrodents has promised not to bite anyone who’s not trying to kill me.” Dumbledore smiled.

“What did you call it-her?”

“Baneofallrodents. Oh. Sorry. Baneofallrodents.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled again.

“Bane of all rodents? What an unusual name. I suppose you have a point. Very well. You have a week long probationary period, and if it proves to be that you can control her you may keep her.”

“Thank you.”

“Now, my boy, I would like to reaffirm that you will be safe at Hogwarts. Nobody will try to kill you here.”

“Ding,” Harry said, and noticed McGonagall cover her mouth with her hand and exchange an amused look with Snape. “Enormous three headed dogs. A troll. An insane genocidal lunatic who taught Defence Against the Dark Arts. To mention a few.”

“Ah, yes.”

“Will that be all, Professor?” he said, pasting on his sweetest and most innocent expression. Snape rolled his eyes and Harry cheered silently in victory.

“Yes Mr Potter. That will be all.”

/

Harry strode into Transfiguration, Baneofallrodents wrapped around his neck. There had already been one incident that morning with Scabbers, but Ron had managed to snatch the rat away just in time. “You should be a keeper, with those reflexes.” Harry had remarked, and Ron had been so astounded by the sudden compliment that he forgot to berate Harry for allowing his snake to attack Ron’s rat.

“You look nice today,” he told Hermione, seating himself next to her. She blushed. Harry smiled inwardly. Point to him.

“Quiet please,” McGonagall said. “Today we shall be learning how to turn a rabbit into a slipper.” There was a flick of her wand and a rabbit appeared on each of their tables. Baneofallrodents lunged forward, biting the rabbit. Everyone stared. Baneofallrodents began the slow process of swallowing it. Harry smiled sheepishly.

“Sorry. She’s hungry. Next time give me a warning, and I’ll tell her not to eat it,” he told McGonagall. “Naughty. I told you not to bite anything!” He hissed.

“You told me not to bite any human," she replied, rather smug to have found a loophole. Harry sighed.

“Well now I’m telling you not to bite anything unless I tell you that it is food.”

“Fine," she hissed in a resigned voice. Harry smiled winningly.

“She won’t do it again.” McGonagall stared at Baneofallrodents, a perturbed expression upon her face.

“See that she doesn’t,” she said, and with a wave of her wand Harry had another rabbit.

+

“What’s this about me being the Heir of Slytherin, then?” he asked his part of Gryffindor table. A number of them blushed, or looked away. He could feel the rest of the Hall quiet. Ah, the profits of being famous.

“Slytherin,” he instructed the table, as if the entire Hall wasn’t listening. “Slytherin is the house of cunning. If I was the Heir of Slytherin, why on earth would I demonstrate that I was a parselmouth, and have a pet snake? It’s far too obvious. Besides, those of you who have done your research know that the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, and I wasn’t even alive then. So it’s obviously not me.”

“Who is in then?” someone cried, and he saw Snape wince. Hehe. He turned to the rest of the hall, not even bothering to pretend that he wasn’t addressing them all.

“Well that is the question. Who was alive when it first opened? Who would we least expect it to be? And who is a powerful enough wizard to open the Chamber?” They waited with bated breath. Harry smirked.

“Professor Dumbledore, of course.” Snape looked resigned. Dumbledore looked surprised. Hagrid looked angry. McGonagall looked amused. The students gasped, and as one turned to look at the teacher’s table. Harry supressed a giggle. What a load of idiots.

“Harry,” Hermione hissed to get his attention. Students began running out the hall, likely to inform their parents. Oh he was good, he was so good.

“Come along minions, off we go to Potions,” Harry said, and led the way.

+

He sat next to Hermione in Potions.

“Aw come on mate, we always sit together,” Ron said. Harry smiled viciously.

“Yes, you’re the reason our potions are what some might call disastrous, or others might call catastrophically awful. You lack the fortitude for hard work and concentration that Potions requires, and the mental acuity to understand the interactions between ingredients that is essential for the completion of any potion harder than a cure for boils. Don’t worry, you can partner with Seamus, perhaps that way only one cauldron, instead of two gets blown up.” Ron frowned.

“So we’re making new friends? Okay!” Harry stared. How had he put up with that imbecile for over a year?

“You really shouldn’t be so hard on him,” Hermione told him snottily, but he could see a faint glimmer of amusement in her eye.

“I’ll stop being mean when he stops being an idiot.”

“Ah, I see. So never?” she said. Harry beamed and patted her on the head.

“Hurrah, you’re learning!”

/

Harry and Hermione grinned at each other, then downed the Polyjuice. Harry couldn’t actually believe Hermione was joining him, but he wasn’t one to look a gift hippogriff in the mouth. They ambled into the Great Hall, arms linked. Fred and George were sitting side by side, focused on their food. A few people glanced up, then frowned as they noticed there were two sets of Weasley twins, and the whispers began. Harry sat next to twin one, and Hermione sat opposite him.

“Hello Fred,” he said. Twin one looked up and grinned.

“Hello George,” came the instant reply. Then twin one glanced either side of him. “We’ve multiplied!” he cried. Harry grinned.

“I thought I was George?” Hermione said.

Harry frowned. “No. I’m George.”

“No, I am!” Twin two declared.

“You can’t all be George!” Twin one insisted. Hermione pouted.

“If I’m not George, then who am I?” she asked.

Out the corner of his eye Harry caught a flicker of movement.

“Uho! Bat incoming!” he yelled. “Scatter!” All four of them jumped up from the Gryffindor table and ran in different directions. Hermione had evidently embraced her role, and had jumped onto the Hufflepuff table, and was charging down it, sending platters of food crashing to the floor. Twin two was crawling under the benches.

“To the window.” Twin one cried as he ran frantically toward the window behind the teacher’s table.

“To the wall!” Harry threw himself against the stone wall of the Great Hall. Snape paused, glaring at all of them, trying to decide which one to go after.

“Til the sweat drips off my-“

“WEASLEY!” Snape bellowed.

“RUN!” Twin two screamed, wriggling out from between Angelina’s legs, and they all legged it out the hall.

They ended up in an unused classroom, giggling on the floor.

“That was brilliant!” Twin one said. “Now, let’s see.”

"Who our fellow troublemakers could be,” Twin two finished. He whipped out a piece of parchment. “I solemnly swear I am up to no good,” he muttered.

“That’s the Marauder’s Map!” Harry said. Both twins looked up and frowned.

“It was lovely to meet you, Sally, but I’m afraid my friends are probably missing me. Is there any way for me to get out of here?” Harry asked the thought that had been plaguing his mind since he’d fallen down the tunnel. He was hungry. Sally hissed in what sounded like amusement.

“Come.” He followed her through another set of tunnels, until they reached a pipe like the one he’d fallen down. “Perch on my head, and I shall lift you up.” Harry cautiously climbed up her frame, and Sally lifted them up through the tunnel.

“Open.” Harry scrambled onto a tiled floor. He turned back to look Sally in the eye.

“Harry!” Someone shrieked.

“Thank you,” he hissed. Sally disappeared back down. “Close.”

“Harry! Was that a basilisk?” Hermione yelled. Harry grinned sheepishly at her.

“Yeah. She’s called Sally. We’re friends now.”

“You can’t befriend a basilisk!” Hermione exclaimed. Harry shrugged.

“We’re in a crack fic, Hermione. It’s expected.”

“What?” Hermione said, her brow wrinkled. Harry shook his head.

“Don’t worry dear. Oh, look! A stack of books!” Hermine perked up, and her nose flared, like a hound with a scent.

“Books?” She swivelled around and broke the sound barrier to reach the pile of tomes upon the floor next to her.

“You must have dropped them.” He helped her pick them up. A glance around showed that he was in a bathroom.

“Oh my! A boy in a girl’s bathroom! You shouldn’t be here.” Moaning Myrtle floated out of a toilet and Harry bit back a sigh. At least that answered the question of which bathroom.

“I was looking for you,” Harry lied. “I heard that there was a beautiful ghost haunting one of the bathrooms, and I just had to see for myself.”

“Oh my!” Myrtle moaned. She blushed, and flew into the toilet, splashing water everywhere.

“You’re a fiend, Harry Potter!” Hermione cried with a huff, flicking water out of her eyes, and stalked out of the room. Harry grinned, and trailed after her, winking at Malfoy who was gawping at them as they left the bathroom.

/

“Weasley, what would I get if I added powdered gundleroot to a shrinking concoction?” Weasley gaped at him, and Severus rolled his eyes. “Nothing to say? I suppose it was optimistic to hope for an intelligent response.” He spun to face the Slytherin side of the room.

“Mr Malfoy?” Draco glared at him, and crossed his arms. Severus frowned. Draco could usually be counted upon to answer. “No?”

Draco opened his mouth to speak, and nothing came out.

“Someone silenced him, sir, and no one can remove it,” Greengrass explained.

Severus wondered if he should feel guilty for leaving Draco silenced for nearly a week, but found it rather amusing that none of the older students had felt inclined to help.

“Finite.”

“About time!” Draco hissed, and every face in the room fell as he regained his voice. Not even a single Slytherin seemed pleased that he could speak once more. “And it would explode… obviously.” 

“Five points to Slytherin,” Severus awarded. Draco might have been a little twerp, but at least he knew his potions.

/

“Potter!” Malfoy spat, barging unannounced into their carriage. Harry sighed.

“We’re busy right now, Malfoy, so just go away.” He made a shooing motion with his hands. “We’ll assume that whatever it was that you came in to say was suitably witty and your goons cackled in amusement while I flushed with indignant embarrassment and rage.”

“I-what?” Malfoy said.

“Yes yes, you’re very scary, off you pop now.” Harry flicked his wand and a blast of wind blew Malfoy out of the room and into the corridor, slamming the door shut behind him. “Colloportus,” Harry muttered and the lock clicked shut. The door knob rattled several times, but eventually Malfoy stalked away.

Hermione gave him an appraising look.

“You’ve really improved with your studies lately.” Harry flushed. “Were you holding back before?” Harry smiled weakly.

“Well. I wouldn’t say holding back… exactly,” he hedged.

“Harry James Potter!” Hermione growled, and Harry was lectured about academic achievement and reaching his potential all the way to Kings Cross. He even considered waking Ron up, but realised that just meant two of them would have to suffer. He then considered jumping out of the carriage window, but figured he was just making Voldemort’s job easy for him.

By the time they reached the station Harry was more than ready to get off the train. Ron had woken up halfway through the rant and was curled up in a corner with his hands over his ears, whimpering. Harry wasn’t far from that state himself.

“See you in a couple weeks!” Harry yelled, and grabbed his trunk, running off the train.

“Sirius, thank Merlin, you have to save me!” he cried as he almost instantly ran into his godfather. Sirius sneered and Harry frowned. “Wait-“

“Morsmordre!” Sirius cried, pressing a scarf to Harry’s neck. Immediately it felt as if something had hooked about his navel and yanked. Harry yelled as he was pulled through space, and he landed on the ground with a thud. He rolled with the movement and came up with his wand in his hand.

“You’re not Sirius,” Harry said. Polyjuice, perhaps? Sirius’ doppelganger grinned, and licked his lips. A jet of light flew from his wand and Harry ducked, hiding behind a massive stone. As Harry glanced about he realised he was in a graveyard, nowhere he’d ever been before.

Suddenly, there was a burst of pain on his forehead and Harry screamed, clutching his scar.

“Master?” Baneofallrodents hissed. Harry fell forward and curled up on the ground. The pain was fading but it was still there, as if his scar was being created anew, splitting his skull apart.

“Run and hide,” he replied through gritted teeth and she slithered away.

His wand was snatched from his grasp, and Harry was bound to a stone angel. He squirmed, but the ropes only tightened, almost choking him. A cauldron bubbled before him and Pettigrew approached, holding something in his arms.

“Ah!” The Sirius doppelganger cried, and clutched his leg. “A fucking snake bit me!”

“There are only adders and grass snakes in Britain.” A sibilant voice hissed from the bundle in Pettigrew’s arms, and if Harry hadn’t guessed it was Voldemort before, he knew now for certain. “You will survive.” Harry squeezed his eyes shut and tried to ignore the blinding pain.

“Eep!” Pettigrew shrieked. “It bit me too!”

“Stop this nonsense!” Voldemort roared, although as he was currently inhabiting the body of a small child it was more of a squeak. “Ignore the bites, and return me to my former glory.”

“Of course, master,” The Death Eaters replied and bowed to Babymort, then deposited him in the cauldron. Harry really hoped Babymort drowned.

“Bone of the father, unknowingly given,” Pettigrew rasped, and a thin trickle of bone rose from the ground and flew into the cauldron.

“Flesh of the servant, willingly given,” Pettigrew raised a knife, and his own hand, and sliced it off. Harry flinched and looked away from the bloody stump.

“Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken,” Pettigrew dug the knife into Harry’s arm, even as his own fingers trembled.

“I give it freely!” Harry cried, but Pettigrew merely snarled at him, dripping the blood into the cauldron. Immediately it began to boil.

The Sirius doppelganger was swaying on his feet, and Pettigrew had already collapsed.

“Baneofallrodents, get my wand!” Out of the shadows Baneofallrodents appeared. She tripped the doppelganger, then wrapped her tail around Harry’s wand and slithered over to him. Harry grabbed it.

“Diffindo.” He cut the ropes and scooped Baneofallrodents up. While he’d been planning his escape, Voldemort’s body had been forming from the cauldron.

“Robe me,” Voldemort demanded. Harry sprinted away toward the nearest country path. “Wormtail? Barty! POTTER!”

Harry raised his wand. “The Knight Bus!” he yelled, hoping it would work.

With a loud honk an enormous purple double decker bus appeared from out of nowhere.

“Welcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the stranded-“

Harry leapt on board. “Go! Go! Go! He’s trying to kill me.” The conductor blinked, looking up from the notecard he was reciting from.

“Wut?” A flash of red light flew toward them. Harry ducked and it crashed into the seat behind him, which shrivelled and curled in on itself.

“Oh bloody ‘ell, go Ernie go!”

+

Slowly, quietly, Harry regaled his tail.

“Codswallop!” Fudge announced at the end.

“Are you accusing the Heir of House Black and House Potter of lying?” Sirius hissed. Fudge gulped.

“It can’t be true! He can’t be back!”

“May I inspect your memory?” Director Bones asked, ignoring their arguement. Harry nodded, and tilted his head. She withdrew a silvery stream of liquid from his mind and placed it into a vial.

“I refuse to believe You Know Who is back!” Fudge cried.

“He might not be,” Harry spoke up. Fudge gazed at him, an expectant look upon his face. “It was definitely him, but my snake had bitten both Pettigrew and Barty, that’s why they collapsed. She’s an Eastern Brown Snake, and the venom is quite fatal.” Baneofallrodents chose that moment to poke her head out from underneath his shirt and Fudge jumped back in surprise, nearly toppling to the floor.

“They tasted like rotten rodents.”

“Pettigrew used his hand to regenerate Voldemort… he may have passed the poison in his blood stream onto Voldemort.” Director Bones gave both him and Baneofallrodents an appraising look.

The sorting felt as if it was taking forever, and he joined Ron, for once, in groaning with joy when the food arrived at their tables.

“Bout time,” Ron muttered around a mouthful of potato he’d picked up with his hands and jammed into his mouth. Globs of gravy ran down his face, and Harry couldn’t look away, watching with morbid fascination at the amount of food he managed to consume within seconds.

“Ron! Mind your manners!” Hermione scolded. Several first years were also transfixed, and one particularly small girl looked as if she was about to faint.

BANG! The explosion drew the attention away from Ron. Seamus was grinning ear from ear, his eyebrows burnt to cinders and parts of his hair and uniform still flaming. He held up a goblet.

“Finally!” he cried, and took a swig.

“Mr Finnegan!” Professor McGonagall appeared behind him, and despite the scorched appearance Seamus still managed to pale. “What in the name of all things do you think you are doing?”

Seamus took another swig of his goblet before turning to face her. McGonagall’s eyes narrowed as she inspected the cup clasped in his hand, and she swiped it up and away from him.

She took a sniff. The entire hall watched with bated breath.

“An excellent water to rum transfiguration,” McGonagall allowed. Harry cheered, even as Hermione glared at him. “Unfortunately, consuming alcohol is illegal for minors. Twenty points from Gryffindor. Don’t do it again.” Seamus turned back to the table, a mischievous grin upon his face. Several upper year students were eying him contemplatively, and Harry used the following uproar as they tried to buy the spell from Seamus to slip away.

+

“For the last time Draco, what have I told you about telling tales about Potter?” Snape growled. Malfoy was quivering under his glare.

“But sir, I’m telling you, it was a basilisk!” Harry crept past them so that he was behind Snape’s back.

“Enough!” Snape roared. “Detention!” Harry lowered the hood of his cloak, and winked at Malfoy. Malfoy gaped.

“He’s right there!” Malfoy cried. Harry pulled the hood back up and Snape spun around. He narrowed his eyes and turned back to Malfoy once more, who’d gone paler than snow.

“Detention for the rest of the week,” Snape said quietly in a voice more terrifying than when he shouted. “Now begone!”

Harry sneaked away, laughing silently to himself. Served Malfoy right for being such a prat.

+

“I’m worried about Draco Malfoy,” Severus admitted at the first staff meeting of the year. “His jealousy of Potter knows no bounds. Several times he’s come to me with fabricated excuses for getting Potter into trouble, and although you all know how much I’d like that to be true, the stories he comes up with are ridiculous.”

Albus frowned. “Like what, my dear boy?” Severus sneered at him.

“The dragon in first year that Potter was apparently smuggling off grounds. The polyjuice Potter had apparently brewed. The time Potter apparently hid in Lockhart’s office and escaped through a hole in the wall that disappeared before I could even see it. The girl’s bathroom Potter apparently spends his time in. The basilisk that Potter apparently has at his disposal! It’s ludicrous. He’s seeing Potter when he’s not even there. I think he might be delusional,” Severus concluded.

“That is most worrying,” Albus agreed. “Perhaps we should have a discussion with him this evening?” Severus nodded his approval. “Now, moving on. Any other matters we need to discuss?”

“Seamus Finnegan has finally discovered how to transfigure water into rum,” Minerva said. Severus bit back a groan. Every few years a dedicated student managed to create alcohol, and the resulting year was chaos.

“Obliviate him,” Severus suggested. Albus frowned at him over his half-moon glasses in disappointment. Minerva pursed her lips, and Severus was certain she was holding back a smile.

“That’s unethical, I’m afraid,” she said.

“You’ll all have to keep an eye on your older students this year,” Albus said. “And Minerva, please impress upon Mr Finnegan the importance of keeping that spell to himself.”

“Fat lot of good that’ll do,” Minerva muttered.

“Did anyone see where Harry disappeared to during supper?” Lupin piped up. Severus turned to glare at the werewolf. Lupin smiled mildly back at him.

“Probably getting up to some sort of mischief,” he growled.

“Undoubtedly. He’s a thirteen-year-old boy,” Lupin agreed.

“I saw him in the Gryffindor Common Room earlier,” Minerva offered. “Whatever he was doing, it was brief.”

“Thank you, Minerva,” Lupin said.

“Is there anything else that ought to be brought to my attention?” Albus asked, and a litany of denials answered him. “Very well. Thank you all for coming, and good luck with your first set of lessons tomorrow. Poppy, would you mind staying behind? And Severus, would you be as good as to fetch Draco for us?”

Severus nodded and departed to find his troublesome student.

Poppy was waiting quietly in one corner and she cast a few subtle diagnostics as Draco walked in. Severus glanced at her, but she shook her head; nothing wrong with him, as far as she could tell. Draco was glancing nervously about the office, his eyes darting between the three of them.

“You asked for me, Headmaster?”

“Yes, my boy. Please, take a seat,” Albus said. Draco settled into the seat before the desk, looking tiny against the large wooden chair. “Now, Severus has come to me with concerns that you’ve been seeing things that aren’t there.”

Draco’s jaw dropped and he turned to glare at Severus.

“No sir! It’s all true! I’m not imagining things, I know it!”

“Perhaps the best way to settle this would be for us to view the memories with you?” Albus suggested. Severus nodded. A sound idea.

“How?” Draco demanded. Albus frowned, but stood to retrieve his pensieve.

“This is a device that will allow us to extract your memories and view them as if we were standing next to you. Think of the times you believe to have seen something that no one else has.” Draco grimaced, obviously deep in thought. Albus placed his wand against Draco’s forehead, and withdrew a long string of memories, placing them into the pensieve. Both he and Albus plunged forward into the liquid.

As Severus watched each memory, inspecting it for signs of duplicity, his anger grew and grew. Eventually he fell out of the pensieve to be greeted by Draco’s smug grin.

“I told you so,” Draco said, while Severus was still trying to find words to describe his anger. Albus was chuckling beside him.

“POTTER!” he bellowed. “I’M GOING TO KILL HIM!” He could feel his eye twitching, and his blood boiling, and his heart felt like it was going to explode. There was a piercing pain skewering his mind and he was swaying where he stood.

He took a step forward. The pain reached a crescendo, and his brain was shrinking, compressing, dying. His vision tunnelled, and then everything went black.

+

“You killed Professor Snape!” Malfoy bellowed as Harry walked into the Great Hall for breakfast. The whole room fell silent, and expectant eyes turned upon him.

“I have an alibi for the last 24 hours,”  Harry said quickly, but then he smirked at Malfoy. “But please, elaborate.”

The morning post arrived before Malfoy could continue, and Hedwig swooped down with a letter, landing on his shoulder.

It was a howler. Harry nudged it open with the tip of his wand.

“I’M SO PROUD OF YOU!” Sirius’ voice boomed. “SNAPE’S IN THE HOSPITAL WING AND YOU LOST MORE POINTS IN A DAY THAN I MANAGED IN A YEAR. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, KIDDO.” It burnt itself to pieces.

A great cheer erupted around the room, and Fred and George set off some fireworks that exploded in red and gold sparks. People ran over to him, clapping him on the back; Oliver Wood and another sixth year boosted Harry up onto their shoulders. Harry accepted their tributes, as was his due.

There was a loud bang, and all the fireworks vanished; the Weasley twins booed their dismay. Dumbledore was standing at the podium in front of the teachers table.

“If I may have your attention.” Reluctantly the room fell silent, and Harry jumped back down to the floor.

“Professor Snape is merely suffering from a brief illness. He will be back to teaching classes in no time, as I’m glad you will be happy to hear.”

“What a let-down!” Someone from Hufflepuff yelled, and sniggers echoed around the room.

“Now, if you could please return to your breakfast in an orderly and well-mannered fashion, that would be much appreciated.”

Despite their disappointment in discovering that Snape was still alive, all the Houses bar Slytherin were celebrating, and Gryffindor didn’t even care that Harry had lost over five hundred points for keeping a basilisk in the school (amongst other things). He was being treated like a hero, and while he felt vaguely guilty he was also smug that he’d finally gotten to Snape.

In fact, he felt like a true son of a Marauder. Following the Howler, Sirius had written him a long and flowery letter singing Harry’s praises. So, of course, that meant it was time for another prank.

“Harry, they’re saying Snape’s in the hospital wing because of you! He had an aneurysm,” Hermione exclaimed. She’d been late to breakfast, and had missed the announcement.

“I know, isn’t it great!” Harry replied. Hermione recoiled, and Harry thought back on his last sentence.

“What, no!” she cried.

“I know, isn’t it awful!” Harry corrected, crossing his fingers behind his back. Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, but didn’t say anything. “So… I’ve been thinking…”

“Oh no,” Hermione groaned. Harry huffed.

“Rude,” he muttered. “Anyway, I’ve been thinking, that with a little help from Fred and George...” He wiggled his eyebrows at Hermione, who sighed.

“Prank time,” she said, sounding about as unenthusiastic as Ron faced with homework.

“Prank time?” one twin said, popping up next to Harry.

“Sound like our kind of thing,” the other twin said, from next to Hermione. They grinned, and Harry grinned back.

+

Severus had been out of the hospital wing for two days, with instructions to keep his blood pressure down. He fumed at the utterly useless advice, stalking back and forth within his quarters. At least it gave him an excellent reason to quit his job as a teacher once the Dark Lord was finally dead.

Severus patted the vial of basilisk venom hidden in his front pocket. He’d had Albus instruct Potter to extract it, the one good thing to come of the entire situation. The boy had barely been punished! He’d been all for letting Filch get out the thumbscrews.

Pain lanced up his side and Severus hissed, clenching his left forearm with his right hand.

The Dark Mark was burning.

Severus flooed Albus. “He’s calling.”

“Good luck,” Albus said, a solemn look in his eyes.

Severus flooed to the Three Broomsticks, then apparated to Little Hangleton The Dark Lord’s wards prickled as he passed through them, testing him for the Mark. He swept up three dusty stair cases, the once red velvet runner tattered and worn, and into the master bedroom. The Dark Lord was sitting as his desk, looking as if he’d just forced himself from bed.

“Ah, Severus. You have my potions? How was the first week back with those miserable little cretins?” he drawled.

Severus bowed, and the Dark Lord graciously allowed him to his feet. “I have your potions, my lord,” Severus said. “Dumbledore and his ilk are as annoying as usual, and Potter is being his normal spoilt self.”

“They’ll get theirs… all in good time,” the Dark Lord hissed and he fingered his wand. Severus took a deep breath, and handed the Dark Lord his first potion.

“Blood Replenisher, Pepper Up, Strengthening Potion, and a Nutritional Supplement.” The Dark Lord swiped each potion from him and drank it down quickly, grimacing at the taste. Severus clenched his hands behind his back as he handed the last one over. He could feel a bead of sweat forming on his brow.

“Very good, Severus… you are my most faithful – ARK!”

The Dark Lord was clutching his throat, the empty vial of basilisk venom in his hand.

“Expelliarmous!” Severus cried, and snatched the Dark Lord’s wand away as he fumbled with it. The Dark Lord – Voldemort – stared at him incredulously.

“Severus?” he croaked.

“All your horcruxes have been destroyed!” Severus gloated. Voldemort paled, and his eyes bulged.

“Nooo!” Voldemort gargled, collapsing to the floor. “It burns, it burns!” he hissed, writhing about and scratching at the carpet, his breath coming laboured pants. Severus watched with distaste, and vague amusement.

“Mummy!” Voldemort cried. And then he died.

Severus took his time walking back down the stairs. He was admiring his forearm; pale, unmarked skin, a little red, perhaps, but it was free from the vile design that had covered it for so many years. He sent off a spell that would alert the aurors to trouble, and sat on a bench in the garden and waited.

A girl with bubblegum pink hair and a loud voice arrived with Kingsley Shacklebolt.

“Voldemort’s body,” Severus said carefully, “is in the master bedroom of this house.”

The girl’s hair turned bright green, and her jaw dropped. Shacklebolt, luckily, was more professional.

“Go get Madam Bones,” he snapped at the girl. Severus recognised her now; Nymphadora Tonks, mediocrely good at potions for a Hufflepuff.

Severus proceeded to engage in a staring competition with Shacklebolt that he knew he was going to win. He’d stared down Voldemort, Albus, and Minerva. Shacklebolt simply wasn’t intimidating. Shacklebolt sighed as if he’d realised that, and looked away.

CRACK!

Madam Bones, Nymphadora Tonks, four other aurors, Minister Fudge, Rita Skeeter and her photographer arrived. There was an extremely put upon expression on Madam Bones’ face.

“It was merely a potions mishap,” Severus began, “gone awfully wrong…”</pre>

<pre>The first compartment she opened held a pair of boys, with messy and red hair respectively. The redhead was brandishing his wand, which made Hermione think it was at least worth asking, though she guessed they were also first-years, based on their size.

"Excuse me, do either of you know how to do a Summoning Charm? Neville's lost his toad," explained Hermione.

"Uh, no," said the redhead. "Think it goes 'achio' or something, mum does it all the time at home."

"All right, thanks. Sorry to interrupt. Were you about to practice a spell?" she asked with some enthusiasm, trying to be polite.

"Yeah…" He cleared his throat elaborately.

"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow; Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow," he intoned, waving his wand imprecisely at the apparently sleeping - and unwell, if the condition of his fur was any indication - rat on his lap. Nothing happened, which did not surprise Hermione at all.

"You didn't get taught that spell by a girl named Mary Sue by any chance, did you?" she asked tentatively.

"What?" asked the redhead. "No. My brother, George. Probably wrong on purpose, he and Fred think they're Merlin reborn when it comes to pranking," he said, a bit glumly. Hermione narrowed her eyes.

"Are they in Gryffindor?" she asked. The boy nodded. Hermione sniffed sharply, then turned to Neville and said, "Sorry, just one second." She drew her wand, pointed it at the sleeping rat and said, "Colovaria!" The rat's fur obligingly turned bright yellow, and all the boys' mouths dropped open. "Just act perfectly normal," Hermione suggested, "when your brother sees him, he'll be trying to figure out how you got his silly made-up spell to actually work." She nodded in satisfaction, then turned to continue down the hallway. Neville shrugged helplessly, then followed.

"Who was that?", she heard the other boy ask from behind her as she walked, followed by the voice of the redhead, who said, "No clue, mate, but she's bloody brilliant - George'll go mental!" Hermione felt a bit guilty that what she'd done and suggested itself might count as a prank, but decided that there must be some pranking equivalent to the legal theory of justifiable self-defence, and let the warm glow of the offhanded compliment propel her onwards.</pre>

<pre>Voldemort was ready to murder someone, at this point.

Perhaps he should clarify; he was essentially always ready to murder someone, more ore less (one could argue it was a fundamental aspect of his personality), but at that particular moment he was...uncommonly eager to commit a heinous act. Murder might be too...anticlimactic, on second thought. Yes, he was actually leaning more toward...genocide. Yes, genocide would be optimal. But he'd settle for mass slaughter.

Or, heaven help him, just one torture curse. Just one.

He glanced around the Room of Requirement, flexing his fingers and summoning Harry's wand to his hand.

"I don't suppose that anyone would like to try their hand at resisting the pain of the cruciatus curse?" he asked, almost hopefully.

Daphne Greengrass's hand shot in the air, but the remainder of Harry's followers appeared quite incredulous and disturbed, so he gifted them with a winning smile. "I'm kidding, of course."

Several awkward laughs.

Ah, foolish children – if you only knew...</pre>

<pre>As far as insults went, he was used to it, and it really wasn't that bad, objectively. It wasn't clever at all. It was actually quite sad. But enough was enough, and suffice it to say that said fourth year Gryffindor wouldn't be using his book bag ever again, nor the textbooks or stationary items that were inside.

Because they were a pile of cinders on the floor of the second floor corridor.

At this point in his life, Harry had mastered lighting things on fire and didn't require a wand or incantation, or even much thought at all, to do it, but the fourth year Gryffindor had still, miraculously, deduced that it was him and wouldn't just let it go, and so they ended up standing in front of a visibly irritated Professor Snape.

"Well?" the Potions Professor drawled after Clara Rosier - one of the few witnesses - dropped them off in front of him.

"Lewis was mocking the traumatic ordeal that was my childhood," Harry deadpanned, utterly fed up at that point. "Sir."

Lewis turned his furious gaze to him, at that. "That's not – he lit my bag on fire!" he spat out.

Professor Snape quirked an unimpressed eyebrow at him, and then turned to Harry. "Did you light Lewis's bag on fire, Potter?"

Harry raised his eyebrows and put a haphazardly innocent look on his face. "I did no such thing, Professor. I just walked away. My wand was in my pocket the whole time."

"Don't lie, you little -"

"Did Potter draw his wand?"

Lewis scowled. "No, but -"

"Hm. Did he say an incantation?"

"No, but -"

"Well then -"

"You saw him with that newspaper!" Lewis blurted out, "He doesn't need a wand! He's some sort of freak -!"

"Ten points from Gryffindor, for interrupting a teacher," Professor Snape hissed menacingly, "Five for insulting another student, make that ten because you've done it twice. Now, dismissed."

Lewis gaped, his face a bright shade of red. Not Gryffindor red, mind you – it was more of a pinkish sort of red. Closer to salmon, you know? "But my bag -"

"It's called spontaneous combustion, Lewis – a rare phenomenon but not unheard of. I suggest you look it up. Dismissed."</pre>

<pre>Harry was visibly troubled by his statement. "But even if the Ministry can't monitor all magical children all the time, surely there's something more that they can do. Visit families. Explain what's happening to them. Check to make sure that the children are happy and well cared for. Anything."

"The Ministry of Magic considers informing young children in the muggle world of their ability to do magic to be a security risk," he countered mildly. Sometimes playing the Devil's Advocate was a pleasant pastime.

"Accidental magic -"

"Can be explained away or covered up in most cases. No, the Ministry considers the risk is too high for the return."

"They have a right to know!" the boy said indignantly, before he added meekly, "Sir."

"Do they? What do they gain, Harry, by knowing of a world unreachable to them? Their home is in the muggle world, and they will have to wait years in order to be able to access this marvelous world of magic that has been introduced to them only in the barest of ways."

A dark look swept over the boy's face. "It's not about what they gain – it's about knowing the truth. It's about knowing what they are."

"And what is that, Harry? Human?"

"But we're not. Not really."

He raised a questioning eyebrow.

"Do you know what they call us, professor? Freaks." The boys eyes were far away, but glimmering a dark and glassy green. "They say that there's something wrong with us – that we're wrong. And they're right, because to them, we are; without magic, we're all wrong – without the magical world, a part of us is missing, and we can never be whole, real. Magic -" he let out a shuddering breath, and if he didn't know better, he would think the boy was in pain "- is everything."

Suddenly, Harry's eyes snapped toward him, capturing him with the fire that was now burning in them; the dark, glassy emerald shade had evaporated, replaced by an unearthly green, nearly glowing.

"It's not fair, that there are children who grow up knowing the wonders of magic, while the rest of us are left as freaks, as wrong. We have a right to know who we are, and what we are, but because the Ministry of Magic is content to leave well enough alone, thousands of children have grown up thinking that there's something wrong with them, when it's really the opposite."

The boy grit his teeth, and he truly appeared to be in pain now. "I spoke to Madame Pomfrey, you know – she told me I'm not alone, and she's right. She told me about the records she keeps, and I know I shouldn't have, but I checked them, I've seen the numbers, and now I know - about how two thirds of the suicides documented among Hogwarts students are muggleborns, about how four fifths of children removed from their homes are removed from muggle homes. Muggleborn students enter the magical world with less knowledge and fewer resources than anyone else, and suffer more prejudice than anyone else, and the fact that they have to face the muggle world alone just makes it worse for them. Those numbers aren't a coincidence, professor, and something has to be done about it!"</pre>

<pre>Professor Dumbledore sighed. "These things usually do, in retrospect. I fear I owe you an apology, Harry. Because, I was aware of the possibility that danger might find you here at Hogwarts, this year. I never meant for you to go seek it out, but it appears I underestimated you."

"It's alright, sir. I think I probably would have done the same in your position."

"Oh?"

"Well, there were four main possible outcomes, right? The first is that I would survive, and Voldemort would get the stone. The second is that I would survive, and Voldemort wouldn't get the stone. Another is that I wouldn't survive, and Voldemort wouldn't get the stone. The last is that I wouldn't survive and Voldemort would still get the stone. No matter what the outcome was, you'd have your proof that Voldemort's still around, and the last outcome is the only one that would be truly disadvantageous for you, isn't it? But for Voldemort, he really only would have considered himself successful if he'd gotten the stone. So no matter what, Voldemort reveals himself, and three times out of four, you win, but Voldemort only wins two times out of four. You clearly were the cleverer one in all of this, Professor."

Professor Dumbledore was staring at him with an unreadable expression on his face. He was getting a lot of those, today.

"I assure you, Harry, that I would never consider your death to be a 'win', as you say."

Harry shrugged. "That's very nice of you sir, but I wouldn't hold it against you if you did."

The elderly man chuckled softly, sounding very old and tired, this time.</pre>

<pre>"I'm almost done." Harry said with humour as the whispers started back and forth. "The last person I'd like to thank is perhaps the most important. Hermione, my soulmate and, on many occasions, my common sense. She has saved my life on more than one occasion and I can only grovel at her feet for how well she's accepted this." The world froze as the purebloods noticed her presence for the first time, the pair staring into each others eyes as the more observant broke through the notice-me-nots on their wedding rings. "For though I was initially against this entire thing, I will forever thank her for reminding me of one simple fact. There is no such thing as a male Veela. My dear, would you do the honours?"

Nica smiled up at him. Lucius's face was contorted into a look of dawning horror as his son pulled a wand through the fabric of his trousers and ruined their lives with one clear feminine command. "Finite."

A collective gasp went through the crowd as the illusions fell. "May I present to you," Harry started as she slipped her wand back into her pantyhose through the slit in her sleek white dress, "for the first time in public, Draconica Malfoy." The young women was radiant in her shape-shifted form, brilliant blue eyes and glorious blonde hair shimmering in the sunlight. There was not a man there who could take his eyes from the form she'd chosen and no one could have possibly doubted her heritage as a Veela.

The assembled purebloods looked as though someone had just killed their favourite House-Elf as he pulled her into glorious kiss.

They came up for air with a pair of smiles as Harry turned to the crowd. "Eyes off, she's mine. I got a little impatient and claimed her yesterday. Sorry about this." He nodded to the still frozen priest, jumped off the podium and watched the crowd descend into chaos as he walked down the aisle with his new mistress.

"What the hell were you thinking Potter and what have you done with Draco?" Lucius snarled as he caught up with them at the edge of the crowd.

"I'm thinking you fucked with the wrong person Lucius." Harry whispered back. "Do put a smile on your face, you're with the Light side now." He said sarcastically as Hermione put an arm round his back and appeared on the other side of him to Nica. A cool bit metal pressed itself against his back and his smirk was strictly predatory as Lucius backed away.

"Now," Harry's magically enhanced voice boomed across the crowd as the Minister started heading in his direction. "I've already waited over a month for this, so you'll have to forgive me if I start our honeymoon in France a little early. Goodbye."

And with that, they were gone, whisked away to the horseshoe turned portkey Hermione had pressed against his back.</pre>

<pre>Tie Dye girl stood in the middle of the room, wand pointed at the red headed first year. Slacker tendencies long gone. Her wand, Harry saw, was twisty and iridescent. The flashing blue and yellow shirt and torn jeans were suddenly intimidating. The long black hair swirling around her helped a bit. That and the cool expression. "Bellatrix Lestrange was my mother's sister. I am the daughter of Andromeda Black. You wanna push me around too?"

Ron's mouth clicked shut. He shook his head back and forth, eyes wide. Good choice. See? Ginger was making progress already. It appeared female influences made more headway with him than male ones. Or at least pretty females with quick wand reflexes.

"Leave the kid alone, you understand me? All of you." Tie Dye girl's gray eyes surveyed the students in the hallway. Everyone nodded. Satisfied Tie Dye girl held a hand out to Harry. "Need a hand?"

He let her pull him to his feet. "How did you do that?"

"What?" Her brows creased.

"The flicking and the muting of the ginger? What was that?" Harry bounced on his feet. "Was it a spell? I didn't hear an incantation. When do we learn that? Can I do it? Is there a distance requirement or will it work as long as it hits the target even if they're really far away? How long does it last? Is it a physical effect or does it interfere with our ability to hear him? Would someone who came by after the spell was cast him be able...oh no I guess they wouldn't..."

"Oh, uh it's a spell. It's not a physical effect. The incantation is silencio and this is the wand movement." She showed him.

Harry twisted his wrist. His wand popped out of the holster. Harry mimicked her. "Like that?" He looked up with large hopeful eyes. "Did I do it right?"

She gave a small squeal. "You're so cute- I mean yes just like that." She ruffled his hair. Tie Die girl glanced between him and Ron. "Hey lets have an impromptu lesson okay? I'll reverse the spell and you try to put it back on him."

Harry shook with excitement. "Lets!"

To Ron's shock and everyone else's amusement the girl flicked her wand again.

"You can't really be using me for a less-"

He was ignored though The Twins did take a moment to conjure some ropes around him to keep him in place. Strictly for academic purposes Harry was sure. They were so sweet to indulge Harry's need to express his curiosity. How did he manage to make such great friends? And a lesson already. Was it too early to earn points? He wasn't assigned a house yet. Harry would ask later.

"Okay. Not physical altering him...which is good because I don't want to accidentally hurt him...this must have some affect on the sound waves leaving him then that negates our reception of his voice...like interference on the telly only without the scratchy noise and all of the pixel-ated chaos." Harry muttered to himself. Confident he knew what he wanted his magic to do Harry flicked his wand at Ron. Thankfully for the sake of the lesson the boy was still yapping away in indignation. Whether he was really that upset or he was finally playing along was anyone's guess.

To Harry's delight it totally worked.

"I did it." Harry spun in a circle. "Fred, George did you see? Draco did you see it? Did you see what I did?" He cast a spell! With an audience and everything. He was a wizard. The best wizard ever. He had no proof of that yet but really it was only a matter of time. All of his family magicks in his little introductory journal worked for him of course but almost never on the very first try. And his aunt said he'd be a failure. He'd show her.

Tie Dye girl's mouth fell open. "He cast non verbally."

Everyone began talking at once.

"Isn't that the kid who tore the wards at Gringotts?"

"I was there that day."

"He did what!?"</pre>

<pre>Harry raised an eyebrow. "And what exactly does Miss Edgecombe claim to have witnessed?" he asked mildly, ignoring the girl's condition. He planned to visit far worse on her once he got the chance. "Perhaps she could tell us herself." The girl whimpered again.

"She is currently incapable of speaking properly," Umbridge cut in. "She very wisely came to me and informed me I would find something quite interesting, should I visit the so-called Room of Requirement tonight. Once I finally got her to admit that it was a meeting of an illegal Dark Arts club, a pair of Binding Spells were called into effect and she was rendered unable to communicate."

Deep within his black little Slytherin heart, Harry was laughing his ass off and tipping his hat to the DA's resident pair of soon-to-be-bikini-clad brainiacs. But on the surface all he did was furrow his brow slightly and ask... "How do you know that it was a spell? I mean, most teenaged girls do tend to get blemishes at some point in their lives. Just because her's happened to have arranged themselves in a pattern that might be misconstrued as a word doesn't mean that there was magic involved."

Slytherin Motto: Deny. Deny. Deny. Well, there was also that thing about "better a cousin than a mudblood", but whoever wrote that had obviously never met Harry's cousin.

"Show him the other one," Umbridge ordered Marietta.

She squinched her eyes closed and opened her mouth. Where her normal flat pink tongue should have been was a nearly foot-and-a-half-long, slender, dark black snake's tongue with a forked tip. It flicked out into the air for a moment, then slid back into Marietta's mouth.

Behind him, Harry heard Hermione gasp and Tracy let out a self-satisfied snort.

"What do you say to that?"

Harry shrugged. "I'd say that her boyfriend is a very lucky man," he replied dryly. Edgecombe went so red with embarrassment that for a moment you could hardly read the word on her forehead and most of the males in the room grinned knowingly. Creevy looked confused, then blushed nearly as hard as Marietta when Fred and George leaned in on either side of him and began whispering in his ears.

Umbridge made a disgusted face, but Fudge ignored her and took over the questioning. "You say that you have not broken any Ministry laws or decrees, correct?" he said harshly.

Harry paused for a moment, thinking it over. He had broken dozens of laws in his short but full life, including several that would have had him in Azkaban in a trice, but nothing that Minister Fudge could possibly know about. "Absolutely not," he stated firmly.

"Then you haven't been secretly teaching a large number of students spells that have been forbidden by the Ministry?"

Harry acted as if he were pleasantly surprised. "Oh, is that what this is about? Well, actually yes, I have been teaching quite a few people at Hogwarts how to defend themselves for some time now, including a bit of what some would consider the Dark Arts. But I can assure you that none of the spells I've been teaching are forbidden or illegal in any way. In fact, we were working on the Patronus Charm just before Professor Umbridge graced us with her delightful presence." He flashed her a charming smile and inwardly howled with laughter at the confused look on her face.

Several members of the DA gasped behind him. McGonagall paled and brought a hand to her chest. Dumbledore hurriedly opened his mouth to speak, but Harry silenced him with a quick look and a discrete gesture of his hand. He sensed Shacklebolt shifting in the seat to his left, getting ready to stand and fight if it came to that, but Harry still had everything under control.

Fudge smiled for the first time since Harry had entered the room. It gave him a shark-like aspect. "So you do admit to breaking the Decree?" he purred.

He shrugged. "I don't see what my teaching Defensive spells to my classmates has to do with any Educational Decrees."

Fudge blinked. "Are you mad? Ministry Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four expressly forbids any such thing without approval from the High Inquisitor!"

Harry smiled at him one more time. This time it was neither polite nor playful. If anything, it was even more shark-like than the one Fudge had just given him. "Actually, it doesn't." He took a moment to soak in the Minister's gobsmacked face before continuing. "Ministry Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four only forbids Student Organizations, Societies, Teams, Groups, and Clubs. The classes that I have conducted don't fall into any of those categories, and so are exempt from it."

There was more muttering behind him. Percy and McGonagall both looked completely lost. Dumbledore eyebrows furrowed briefly, then a tiny, knowing smile crossed his lips. Fudge looked at him like he was a raving lunatic.

"Then what do you call this!" he demanded, jabbing his finger at the assembled DA members.

Harry leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs. "Well, I don't know what you call it, but I know that since Ministry Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four expressly defines all Organizations, Societies, Teams, Groups, and Clubs as, and I quote: a regular meeting of three or more students, then my classes can't possibly qualify as any of them."

He heard a soft gasp followed by a sharp laugh behind him and glanced back to see Tracy staring at him and shaking her head in amusement. He winked at her and she just laughed harder. Hermione looked between them in frustration, still not getting it, then closed her eyes and muttered something briefly to herself. A second later, her eyes popped back open and her mouth formed a into a surprised "O". A catlike grin spread across her lips as she leaned back in her chair, crossed one leg over the other and lifted her chin proudly. Harry smirked at her and her cheeks tinged slightly pink.

Fudge obviously had no idea where Harry was going with this, but could sense that it was going to be unpleasant. "Why not?"

"Because my classes weren't regular," Harry stated simply. "Each and every one of them occurred on a different day and time from the one before. You might say that they were the opposite of regular, random even. Or at the very least intermittent. And since the Oxford English Dictionary defines regular in this context as: occurring at fixed times, then there is no way that we could have possibly broken the Decree." Fudge looked at him in confusion and Harry flashed him another polite grin. "If you don't believe me, just ask your witness over there," he said, nodding at Marietta. He caught Edgecombe's eye for a split second and could see that she now knew just how badly she had fucked up. Harry was mere moments from wiggling his way out of this mess, and they both knew that, once he had, it would be open season on all Sneaks.

Inside, he was laughing a laugh that would have frightened Voldemort. Even if he had wanted to have regular meetings, it would have been impossible, given the need for secrecy and the conflicting schedules of everyone involved. So he had just taken advantage of the lorry-sized loophole that Fudge and Umbridge had dropped into his lap when they had rushed the Decree through the Wizengamot without taking the time to have a solicitor look it over properly.

The goblins would be so proud.

Behind him, the DA also realized that they were in the clear. Several of them were talking excitedly amongst themselves, and the Weasley's twins shared a high-five before directing an identical pair of rude gestures at Ron, who sat near the door with his Prefect and Inquisitorial Squad pins on either side of his collar. He closed his eyes and shook his head, but said nothing.

"You can't possibly be serious!" Fudge sputtered. "You know bloody damn well that's not what the law is referring to!"

Harry's eyes narrowed. "I think you made it perfectly clear at my hearing this summer that the spirit of the law is irrelevant, and it is only the letter of the law that counts. And according to the letter of the law, we have done absolutely nothing wrong," he said in a voice like a razor blade.

Calming himself slightly, he reapplied his polite smile and easy manner. "Now... not to tell you how to do your job, but if I were you, I would have banned organized meetings of three or more people. Had you used that language, then we would have been in clear violation of the Decree."

At this point, Dumbledore broke in. He looked like he was just holding in a belly laugh, and his eyes were twinkling like mad. "I realize that I am no longer sitting on the Wizengamot, Cornelius, but I do still have a great deal of experience in these matters and Mister Potter is quite correct. Should you attempt to bring any of these students up on charges, they will be quickly dismissed."

Fudge looked between him and Harry furiously. His face had gone beet red and each breath seemed to be louder than the last. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to have the immense pleasure of watching the Minister of Magic stroke out and drop dead right here on the Headmaster's carpet, but no such luck.

He pointed a trembling finger at Harry. "You stay," he hissed. "The rest of you children, get out!"

The Inquisitorial Squad wasted no time in jumping up and making for the door. The DA didn't so much as twitch.

"What are you waiting for!" Fudge demanded.

"For you to give them their wands back," Harry replied calmly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, which it was.

Fudge snarled, but nodded at Umbridge. Once their wands had been returned the DA finally made to leave. Several lingered near the door until Harry nodded that it was all right to go, which seemed to make Fudge that much more angry.

As soon as the door shut on the last student, Fudge rounded on Harry and started shouting.</pre>

<pre>There were also a surprisingly lack of quotes – good or bad – from the people he had attended Hogwarts with.

"You taught a lot of them in the DA," Ron explained when he wondered about it, "and a lot of them used that to save themselves or their families. They owe you. A lot of them probably even still trust you, Dark Lordness and all included. The rest ..." he shrugged. "They can't really prove anything yet, but everyone agrees you're the one who killed Malfoy and probably the Lestranges, too. The people you didn't train were mostly Slytherins, Death Eater spawn, or both. Even if they don't have the brains to shut up, you can bet the last thing their families want is for them to open their mouths and piss off someone who can get through the Malfoy wards and kill Lucius Malfoy in his sleep. You were safe to slander back when Fudge didn't want to rock the boat. Can't do the same with a Fiendfyre-happy Dark Lord."

+

"A Gryffindor or a known friend would have been better, but they don't have any of those in Ministry hands they can use. Since Dean left, she's the only one of our year-mates in Auror training."

She ... was? Huh.

"I always thought there would be more," Harry said, a little bemused.

"If you'd joined, there probably would have been." Ernie this time. "Anthony and I both considered it. I know several other 'Puffs did, too. Nowadays we're all a little disillusioned with the Ministry. Most people assumed you would become an Auror. When you didn't ..."

"Some of the Ravenclaws talked about it," Anthony added. "Even if most of us had developed a healthy distrust of the Ministry ... if anyone could have had the perfect career there, it would have been you. Everyone figured you would have been on track to become the Head Auror. Some even considered Auror training because well, even if leadership now wasn't the best, they would very likely spend most of their career with you as their boss. It wasn't a guarantee, but if it came to pass, the general consensus was that you might be a Gryffindor with all that it implies, but you are also the type who would have backed your people no matter what, politics and Ministry corruption included. That you turned down that opportunity was telling."

He trailed off. "That you turned it down to become a Dark Lord instead ... well, we hadn't quite covered that possibility."

Neville snorted. "You didn't seem all that surprised when you lot showed up to interrogate me."

Anthony looked a little embarrassed. "To most Ravenclaws, that issue of the Prophet still came as a complete surprise. The Dark Lord Potter has been a serious topic of Ravenclaw discussion since then. I think the general impression is that it was obvious in retrospect, and we should have seen it coming but then, we hate admitting we're not all-knowing. I wouldn't have had a clue if Dean and Susan hadn't worked out most of it. Hannah, too. Neville spent an awful lot of time in the library and exchanging packages with Hermione all of a sudden."

This time Hermione was the one to look embarrassed. "Most of the books in the Hogwarts Library aren't protected against permanent duplication spells."

"Those spells are difficult." Anthony sounded admiring, Ravenclaw to the bone.

"Not with proper practice. I made Harry learn, too."

Silence. Hannah was the one to speak what most of them were thinking.

"You made a Dark Lord copy library books for you."

"Hogwarts library books!"

"Hogwarts library books," Hannah agreed. "You made a Dark Lord copy Hogwarts library books for you. You're right, that makes all the difference."

Dean was the first to lose it. He started giggling, cast a look at Harry, and then collapsed in helpless laughter. Maybe he had mental images of Voldemort diligently copying first year school books. Harry certainly did now.

Neville offered a rueful smile. "There were some very expensive herbology books among them, you know."

"... It does sound a little silly, when you put it like that," Hermione admitted, a little flushed. "But he didn't object!"

"That's because we all know better than to argue," Harry said fondly. "And it did teach me to focus for longer periods at a time. Even the herbology books."

That was enough to make Hannah lose it as well, closely followed by the others. When the laughter finally died, it had taken a good part of Hannah's tension and anger with it, and when she spoke again she was far calmer.

"They want Susan to contact you. You weren't close friends at Hogwarts, but she was a part of the DA and she fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. She's the closest thing the Ministry has to someone you might actually listen to."

"And they expect me to just trust an Auror trainee that contacts me out of nowhere, even if we fought together?" Harry asked. "I think I'm offended."</pre>

<pre>"Of course, there's also Sirius's trial to slot in there somewhere," he continued, returning to the letter. "She has a Senior Auror by the name of Shacklebolt and an Auror Second Class by the name of Nymphadora Tonks on the case of finding him. She's also asked if we have some way of finding him."

Confused, he looked at her and asked, "Haven't these people got a lick of sense? Just send him a bloody owl! How do they think I get in contact with him?"

Harry heard the auror standing closest behind him suddenly groan in dismay.

When both teens turned to look at him he was staring back at Harry and shaking his head in exasperation. Without a word he then cast an almost silent Patronus and said to it, "Madam Bones, Potter suggests sending an owl to Black."

The Patronus, a small bear, then galloped out through the wall, heading south.

Harry just snorted in amusement and said, "Really? Is everyone in magical Britain that daft?

"Won't he have up owl redirection wards?" asked Hermione.

"Any and all wards, including an owl redirection ward, can only be set up on a place - a fixed position," he replied. "As Sirius is on the move, he will have no such ward set where he is; unless, of course, he's passing through one at the time."

Turning to the auror again, he asked, "You realise that, since you can cast a corporeal messenger Patronus, you could also send him one of those, right?"

The look of pain on the auror's face was, in Harry's book, 'priceless'.

Not waiting for a reply, Harry turned back around, Hermione was only a fraction of a second behind him.

"That's daft," she muttered.

That's when Harry caught out of the corner of his eye a second corporeal Patronus gallop out through the wall.

"They're also forgetting they could use a house elf to take a message to Sirius, as well," he snarked loudly enough for the auror to hear him.

"Oh, for Merlin's sake!" the auror exclaimed.

Neither teen bothered to look, they just smiled at each other.

That had a third messenger Patronus sent.

+

Having just arrived and now sitting in her office, even if it was a Saturday, this time more closely reading Lord Potter and Miss Granger's official statements and taking notes, the Patronus of a small sun bear leapt into her room through the wall.

It spoke with the almost ethereal voice of one of her aurors; one she knew to be currently stationed as one of Potter's bodyguards, "Madam Bones, Potter suggests sending an owl to Black." Before it faded away.

Giving her own groan of exasperation, the Director of the DMLE set aside the statements she was reading and notes she was taking and practically face-palmed herself before she pulled a sheet of parchment before her, together with quill and ink, and set to writing.

A few seconds later, a second sun bear Patronus entered the room from the direction of the first.

"From Potter again, a messenger Patronus should also reach him."

That time she definitely face-palmed herself and groaned. "Damn. Bugger. Shit. Damn!" she vehemently muttered.

It took her a good ten to fifteen seconds before she could return to her writing.

Then the third Patronus entered.

"Potter also just suggested using a house elf to take Black a message."

"Oh, for Merlin's sake!" she more vehemently sighed, unknowingly echoing her auror's own remark. "This is getting ridiculous!"

Once she'd finished writing she pushed the rune stone button on her desk that would summon her personal aide to her.

When the young woman entered Bones said, "If they're in, please send in Shacklebolt and young Tonks."

The aide softly said, "Yes, Ma'am." And walked out, closing the door behind herself again.

Two minutes later, there was a double knock of knuckles on her door before the door opened and both aurors walked in.

"Yes, Ma'am?" asked Shacklebolt in his deep baritone. As senior auror of the two, he spoke first.

"Have either of you thought to send Black an owl asking him to come in?" she asked.

The look of surprise on both faces before they sheepishly glanced at one another gave her the answer. "No, Ma'am," they both replied.

Looking sternly at both, trying to wilt them with her eyes, she then asked, "Do either of you know how to send a messenger Patronus?"

"Errr... yes, Ma'am," replied Shacklebolt as Tonks silently shook her head.

She then waited to see if it would twig to them what she was getting at.

The looks from both of sheepish confusion told her they didn't.

"If you can cast a messenger Patronus, have you thought of sending Black one of those?" she sarcastically asked.

That was the first time she'd ever seen a black man blush in embarrassment.

She knew she shouldn't be hard on them. After all, even she hadn't thought of that communication option. She was just dirty on herself for not thinking of it; and having a fourteen year old school kid, who wasn't even in his OWL year yet, reminding her of it.

"On top of that," she snapped, "What about giving a note to a house elf and having the house elf deliver it?"

Again, both aurors blushed back.

With a sigh, she handed the sheet with the letter she wrote to Black to Shacklebolt and said, "Send this to him using an International owl. The man might not even be in the country, at the moment.

"Then, once you've done that, send him a messenger Patronus and a house elf with a written message."

"Errr... yes, Ma'am," he quietly replied. And both exited again.

She muttered to herself, "We're looking like complete idiots before this young man. And it's our own bloody fault."</pre>

<pre>Harry sighed, tuning out Mrs. Weasley’s lecture about romance and Ginny. The Express was leaving in ten minutes, and she still hadn’t finished! She was just getting to ‘what not to do while dating my daughter’ when he finally interrupted.

I’m sorry Mrs. Weasley, but what’s the point of all this?

The Weasley matriarch huffed. The point is, young man, she said sternly, is that when you date my Ginny, there are rules—

But I’m not dating Ginny!

Oh, come now Harry, said Mrs. Weasley patronisingly, everyone knows Potter men love redheads!

Harry stared at her, before letting a smirk cross his face just as Susan Bones walked by. Yup, he agreed cheerfully, before grabbing the busty ‘Puff ‘round the waist.

The strawberry-blonde blinked in surprise. Harry, wha-MMPH?!

The assembled Weasleys stared in shock as Harry Potter began to enthusiastically snog Susan Bones. Their jaws dropped as one of Harry’s hands glided down to her skirt-clad (hitched up to reveal creamy thighs and a hint of black lace) arse and squeezed happily, the other busy with her shirt-clad chest. Their eyes popped out as Susan wrapped her legs around Harry’s waist and ground herself against him, prompting a ragged groan.

Finally, the snoggers broke off. See? said Harry goofily, a huge grin on his face as he toyed with her covered breasts. Susan whimpered in appreciation; showing that she wasn’t wearing a bra under her shirt.

Molly sputtered. Ginny wasn’t better off.

Just before the duo walked off, Susan turned around. We Hufflepuffs always share, she said sultrily. I don’t mind you joining us.

This time, Ron began to sputter as a furiously blushing Hermione detached herself from the contingent of Weasleys and shyly snuggled herself to the side that Susan wasn’t occupying.

Potters love brunettes too, said Harry agreeably as his free hand gave Hermione’s jean-clad behind an appreciative grope. She squeaked, moulding herself against him even more.

The last thing the dumbstruck family of gingers heard was when the trio had already boarded the train. It was Harry’s voice.

Bloody hell, you shaved it into lightning bolts?! Both of you?! Best… day… ever!</pre>

<pre>James asked Lily out a couple weeks ago and only increased her hatred towards him. He did it in the middle of the Great Hall where everybody watched her slap him in the face with a loud and clear "No!". Now I was stuck with him mooning over her, the first girl to turn him down, and him coming to me for dating advice to get on her good side. Apparently dropping his arrogance and apologizing to both her and Severus were not options, and I was useless.</pre>

<pre>My escape from the Great Hall was thwarted when somebody else called my name. When I looked I saw James waving me over.

Cautiously approaching I looked at Sirius to see him eyeing me as well, but there was still no recognition in his eyes. "What's up guys?"

"Nothing!" Remus glared at his friends, "You can go."

My eyebrows raised in surprise, "What?"

"We were wondering," James gestured to him, Sirius, and Peter, "if Remus really slept with you last night."

My grin was shark like, "All night."

Sirius wolf whistled, and Remus blushed hotly, "No we didn't! We just slept!"

"Yeah," I agreed, "We were pretty tired."

James and Sirius were laughing while Peter was giggling, and Remus just buried his face in his hands. "Ugh."

"It's alright Remus," I would have patted his back, but he was on the other side of the table, "You have nothing to be ashamed about."

As I walked away I heard Sirius' barking laughter smothering Remus' groaning. I wondered how he hadn't recognized me yet. My appearance could change sure, but not my voice. Maybe it's changed since the five months we were apart. I said a few words to myself as I walked up to Ravenclaw tower. I couldn't hear much of a difference, but I just now realized its lost the French hint it had thanks to being Édouard.

Well, I thought to myself as I hopped in the shower, Sirius can be pretty dense.

The thought made me feel better, and for the rest of my shower I thought of when it would be best to reveal myself. This year? Or maybe later?</pre>

<pre>Amelia had no sooner walked out the door when Malfoy sauntered over to the Gryffindor table with his two ape-shaped bookends, Crabbe and Goyle.

"So, Potter," he drawled with a sneer. He didn't see an auror suddenly peel off from the wall not that far away and approach from his side. "You seem to have managed to do what no one else has done and gotten rid of―"

That was as far as he got before the auror pushed bookend number one out of the way and firmly placed his hand on Malfoy's shoulder.

Malfoy's head spun about it shock.

"I do believe Madam Bones just got done telling everyone to leave Potter alone," drawled the auror. "Do you want to be the first suspended and sent home in disgrace?"

Malfoy appeared to try and shake the hand off his shoulder. But the auror merely tightened his grip.

"I asked you a question, lad," the auror more firmly stated.

"Let go of me!" Malfoy practically squealed, still trying to shake the auror's hand off.

Instead of doing so, the auror then reached out with his other hand and snagged Malfoy by the wrist. A quick twist and Malfoy's wand arm was now twisted up behind his back.

Malfoy gave a strangled little yelp as the auror manhandled him into a police-style 'compliance' hold.

"Again," snapped the auror. "Do you want to be the first person sent home in disgrace?"

"No!" yelped the ferret.

Then the auror simply marched him back across the Hall to the Slytherin table before he gave him one last shove. Malfoy staggered forward two steps, spun about and glared back.

"The next time you cross the Hall with the intention of bothering Lord Potter," snapped the auror, "You will be arrested and taken to the DMLE. You should expect to be suspended from Hogwarts at that time."

Malfoy spluttered a moment and then bawled, "When my father hears of this―"

The auror rode right over him and snapped back, "Threatening an auror in the course of their duties is an automatic stay in Azkaban. You want to watch what you say to me... boy."

That shut Malfoy right up.

"As for your father, you can be most assured that he'll 'hear about this', as you put it," the auror continued. "As you're under-aged, we're bound by law to immediately notify him when we arrest you."

The auror then glared back for a few moments to make sure his message was received, before he spun about and stalked back to 'his' spot standing with his back to the wall.

Harry and Hermione watched the entire thing, surprised. It was the first time, that Harry could recall, when an adult actually moved to protect him from the blonde ferret.

What neither teen knew was that the warning of the auror's actions were received by the entire school collection of both students and remaining staff; including Weasley.

He'd been about to confront Harry himself just as Malfoy made his play. Seeing what happened to Malfoy actually managed to get through Weasley's head enough to make the boy reconsider his actions.

'I'll wait until we're in the Gryffindor tower,' he thought.</pre>

<pre>Memory-Harry held the smirk and the apparent stare at the VIP stand for a long couple of seconds before he began to speak again.

"'Everyone knows' is a term I hear far too many wizards and witches say," he said. "Everyone knows what befell the Potters in Godric's Hollow on the evening of the thirty-first of October, 1981. Everyone knows the Killing Curse rips the soul from the victim, while also leaving no mark upon the victim's body. Everyone knows Sirius Black betrayed them, led He-Who to their cottage, then went on to kill Peter Pettigrew and a dozen muggles a few days later. Everyone knows―"

He gave a snort and said, "But I know that everyone is wrong!

"I've already shown you evidence that Peter Pettigrew is alive... or, was at least alive on the ninth of June, earlier this year. At that same time I also showed you that Sirius Black is completely innocent of the crimes for which he was dumped into Azkaban without even a trial. So, that shows you quite a significant portion of what you believe to have happened that night in Godric's Hollow - and what happened a few days later regarding the supposed death of Peter Pettigrew and those muggles - is wrong. You now know that what 'everyone knows' is wrong. It is a lie!

"Now for the second point I raised; that 'everyone knows' the Killing Curse rips the soul from the body.

"Well... news flash, people: that's not true, either."

Memory-Harry gave that a while to sink into the consciousness of 'his' audience before he continued. And, just as Harry thought it would, it caused a mass gasp of shock and surprise among those watching from the stands.

"You, see," he began again, "What the Killing Curse does is strip the mind of every piece of knowledge. It wipes the mind bank - including all the autonomic systems. The brain forgets to send the information it needs to run the automatic biological systems; the heart to pump, the diaphragm to cause the lungs to regularly inflate and deflate, the stomach and intestines to process food and waste, the consciousness to receive information from the five senses, etcetera. Without the heart beating, without the lungs pumping, the body dies.

"In pure essence, the Killing Curse is nothing more than a very high powered Obliviation charm. That's why the Killing Curse, just like the Obliviation charm, leaves no physical mark on the body.

"And it's that knowledge that leads to the answer - the riddle, if you will, that has plagued the wizarding world since that horrid night - as to why I managed to survive being hit with the Killing Curse."

Again he paused and smirked, before aiming that smirk directly at the VIP seats.

"You see," he began as his smirk widened into a grin, "I'm immune to any and all mind-controlling magic; including the Killing Curse, the Confundus Charm, other Compulsion Charms and... the Obliviation Charm."

Up in the stand Dumbledore gave a physical start, which had Bones again firmly jab her wand tip into the back of his neck. He didn't even feel it.

'Oh, shyte!' he thought, as all colour drained from his face and he began to feel quite sick and faint.

He now knew what the Potter boy's plan was. Though loathe to, he had to admit it was brilliant.</pre>

<pre>"What would be a likely password?" he wondered, for he suspected that this entrance, unlike the entrances to Hufflepuff, the kitchens and Diagon Alley, required a verbal password rather than a physical interaction. "Salazar?" he asked the wall. The wall did not answer. "Tradition," he tried. "Pride. Ambition. Phineas the Bold. Honor. Respect your elders. I'm grasping at straws, here."

Harry was starting to get pretty frustrated by that point. Glaring up at the stupid ouroboros etching, he snapped at it, "Just open your arse up!"

To his shock, the little ouroboros spun about its axis, doing a full three-sixty, and then the section of wall which had frustrated him jerked back and slid to one side in a manner not entirely unlike the automatic door at his favorite electronics store (something which he would definitely not say out loud), allowing him passage.

"Nox," he muttered, staring at the hole in the wall in bewilderment. Leave it to Slytherin House to not have a password at all, but just have a door that only opens if you tell it to in a sufficiently authoritarian way. Shaking his head and wondering what he was getting himself into, Harry entered.</pre>

<pre>"Arrogant brat! Just like your father!" the greasy haired man sneered down at him.

Arrogance? Harry's Father was many things, arrogant being the least of them. Still, Harry's heart warmed with a fierce pride. It was good to know, that even here, his Father was feared and respected. Harry reflected a moment... Yes, the Angel who usurped a third of God's Army and waged war on God Himself, yes, Harry's Father was arrogant and rightly so. It was right that this greasy haired man thing... Snipe? Snope? Snope. It was right that Professor Snope feared and respected both him and his Father.

~oOo~

"Honestly, she's a terror! It's no wonder she hasn't got any friends!"

Curiosity pricked, Harry watched as the Bushy-Haired-One trampled Rat-Boy and stormed off.

He made a note of getting to know her later. Terror was good. And her trampling was quite well done for an amateur.

~oOo~

"Troll! Troll in the dungeons!", Quirrel skidded to a halt. "Thought you should know."

As Professor Dumbledore stood up, no-one noticed Harry dart out the door.

"Ah yes, as we all know, we've recently negotiated a peace treaty with the trolls of the Highlands. As a symbol of this new age of peace and prosperity, a diplomat from the high mountains has been sent to give a guest lecture on trollish customs and history. It gives me great pride and joy to present to you-"

A thunderous boom echoes throughout the chamber as Harry Potter throws open the doors.

"Don't worry about the troll, I've killed it." Announced Harry with no small amount of pride. Phew, that was a close one. Peace? Prosperity? That would not help him AT ALL.

~oOo~

Severus Snape quietly counted to ten under his breath before entering the Headmaster's office. The old man had done nothing when Potter and his cornies had tried to feed Crabbe and Goyle to the giant squid. But now, now he had them.

"Headmaster, I demand that you expel the Potter brat!"

Dumbledore looked up from his crossword. A burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. Eight letters, begins with the letter 'A'.

"Now Severus. What seems to be the problem?"

"I found him and his cronies in the dungeons. They had kidnapped Draco, stripped him naked, tied him down and covered him in goat's blood. Apparently, he was to be a 'virgin sacrifice to Yog-Sothoth'."

"Now Severus, you really must put this childish grudge you have against James behind you. Clearly the child has Lily's sense of humour."

"The end of the world is not a joke, nor a prank, nor is it particularly funny, Headmaster."

"Were they successful in summoning Yog-Sothoth?", oddly enough Dumbledore seemed quite hopeful about this.

Snape once again counted to ten under his breath.

"As we are both still alive and the castle is still standing, obviously not."

Dumbledore had long held the belief that only those who were truly evil and steeped in dark magic could fully understand the Dark Arts. As such, only they could adequately prepare the youth of the nation to defend against it.

One of the reasons that he had waited so long before finally hiring Voldemort to teach was the fact that, at the time of his application, Riddle simply was not evil enough to teach DADA. Had the children been successful, it would have solved the problem of finding a new professor for next year. Yog-Sothoth would have made an excellent Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and additionally, it would have given him the opportunity to redeem a malignant deity.

"Now, now, the books on Demonology are safely in the restricted section, we won't have to worry about that for several more years. Really, you must learn to lighten up and see the humour in these situations."

"One, two, three...", eyes closed Snape once again began to count.

The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea. Redeeming Yog-Sothoth while at the same time finding a professor that wouldn't be killed by the DADA curse. An Old One would have little use for money, so it would greatly help the school's budget as well. There really was no downside as far as he could tell. Perhaps a pass to the restricted section for the Granger girl would be in order?

"I still don't see why you were so worked up about the werewolf incident. Really, trying to feed a Slytherin to a werewolf is hilarious on so many levels, if you stop and think about it. In fact -"

Dumbledore never had a chance to finish the sentence, because it was at this time that Snape chose to break the senile old man's nose.

+

"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!"

Xenophilius looked up from his latest project, creating a "Find-Anythinge-Device" to help find his old Find-Anythinge-Device which had been misplaced.

"What is it Dew Drop?"

"It's the Rotfangs again! They want to renew their contract."

After the Quibbler revealed their existence to the world a few years ago, the Rotfang Conspiracy had met in secret, as they always did, to determine the best way to deal with their security. It was quickly determined that Lovegood had somehow found a way around their secrecy charms.

Reasoning that the only man alive that could possibly know the means to defeat Lovegood's anti-secrecy charms was Xenophilius Lovegood, the Rotfangs had approached Xenophilius and had worked out a rental agreement. After all, they reasoned, the man must be a security expert of some sort, so his secrecy charms must be amazingly effective.

The decision to meet in Xenophilius' basement went something like this:

"Xenophilius has broken through our secrecy charms."

"Who do we know of that could stop him from doing so in the future?"

"Uhh... Xenophilius?"

"That's brilliant. See about renting a conference room from him."

"But..."

"Hop to it man, were wasting precious time out in the open like this."

As such, the Rotfangs now met every other Thursday night in the only place in England safe from Lovegood's eavesdropping. The "secret" subbasement of Quibbler publishing incorporated was, in theory, warded with secrecy charms that not even Xenophilius himself could break.

Harry Potter stared at the back of the goblin's head. A quick trip to Diagon Ally seemed good in theory, but in reality first you had to go through that stupid restaurant, then you had to wait precious seconds while the stupid door opened, then you had to wait on stupid goblins, then you had to take a stupid roller coaster ride to go to the WRONG vault to get some stupid wizarding money...

And they didn't even give him the right vault! He should have vault 666 not vault 687! He had asked about swapping, but apparently he had to wait till the vault owner of 666 died before he could claim it. And the stupid goblins wouldn't even tell him who currently owned it, so he couldn't go find the owner of HIS vault and liberate it.

Stupid goblins.

Stupid roller coaster.

Stupid underground dragons.

Stupid hell hound sticking his head out the cart.

"Can't this thing go any faster?"

"No."

Stupid goblins.

Push!

The cart bounced up and down merrily as it ran over the stupid goblin.

Upon reflection, Harry decided the cart ride was kind of fun actually. More so now that he was the one pulling the lever.

Except the lever didn't seem to actually do anything.

Stupid goblin lever.

Stupid goblin cart.

The cart coasted to a stop in front of Harry's vault.

Both Harry and Ripper stared at the vault door for a moment.

"Do you know how to open this thing?"

"Only Goblins can unlock it. We had a Goblin, but SOMEONE seems to have misplaced it."

…

"Bugger"

Stupid goblins.

Well, one good thing came of this atleast. Now he could walk to vault 666, pry off the numbers and swap them with the numbers on his vault.

~oOo~

Ragnok stared at the little human in front of him. "Mr. Potter. Goblins do not simply 'fall' out of mining carts."

"Well, maybe he's not much of a goblin then."

He had to admit to himself, that the child had a point. In his day, anyone foolish enough to turn their back to a hell hound got what he deserved. But on the other hand, it wouldn't do to have wizards pushing goblins out of carts.

"Mr. Potter, the surveillance footage clearly shows you pushing Griphook out of the cart. Your voice can clearly be heard laughing at him."

"Oh... Well, is it against the rules or something? I don't remember reading anything about NOT pushing goblins out of carts in your bank brochure."

Technically this was true. Until now the bank had never thought to include the "Do not push your goblin out of the cart" policy. Nor had thought to include the "Do not steal someone else's vault numbers" policy.

His father never had problems like this.

"Look kid, it's simple. You get in the cart, you go to your vault and either put stuff in or take stuff out. Then you get back in the cart and then leave. It's not that complicated."

Stupid humans.</pre>

"Of course it did, my boy. You are, after all, the son of your father. The very FIRST snake. It only makes sense."

"You'll tell me more about my real father when we go home, and how the false god Yahweh cast him out of paradise?"

"Of course, Little Horn. But first, lets go get some ice cream."

"Ok, just a minute, let me set lose this imprisoned serpent."

As the snake slithered away, Vernon couldn't help but wonder what the snake was talking about.

"Oh, he just wanted to go home to Brazil. Well, after he found and killed the mean two-legs that tormented him."

"And rightly so," chimed Aunt Petunia. "Remember boys, vengeance is one of the seven Beautiful Graces bestowed upon man by Harry's real father. Just remember, when seeking vengeance not-"

"Not to get caught, and to make sure someone else is blamed," recited both Harry and Dudley in unison.

"Excellent! Now, lets go find that ice cream stand!"</pre>

<pre>Severus Snape did not intend to be Filch's assistant caretaker. Still, he would have to make the most of it. And he would do a good job. He had one tool which Filch or Wilson did not have. He had the wand and the ability to perform magic. Snape figured no matter how hard the mess, he would have this castle shining so good you could eat off of the floors.

"I'll take this, Severus."

Dumbledore removed the wand from Snape's hand which caused him to stagger a bit. Snape opened his mouth.

"What's the meaning of this, Headmaster?" Snape asked.

Dumbledore broke in with a jovial smile. "Well, you said you would fill in for Professor Assistant Caretaker Wilson. And to properly fill in, you will need to get into the spirit of the matter. That means you will have to clean this castle without the aid of a wand or without magic."

"What about if…."

"Severus, my dear child," Dumbledore said. "You will be able to collect your wand from my office. And maybe you can have a lemon drop if you were a good boy and cleaned the castle."

Given Dumbledore's attitude over recent years, Snape did not even want to know what his lemon drops were laced with. Snape feared for the Headmaster's sanity and if he did not pledge his service to Hogwarts for the rest of his life, in exchange for Dumbledore vouching for him at his trial, Snape would have tendered his resignation.

'Some days, I think Azkaban might have been the better option," Snape said. 'Well, the fool forgot that I could perform wandless….'

A click indicated a pair of bracelets came around Snape's wrists. His thought paused as he noticed what looked to be a pair of fuzzy looking handcuffs, only not linked together. Dumbledore gave him a smile and patted him on the head.

"Almost forgot you can perform magic without a wand," Dumbledore said. "Therefore, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to put those inhibitor cuffs on you...I used those for alternate purposes during the day, you know."

Dumbledore's eye twinkled. Snape did not know. Snape did not want to know. Albus Dumbledore's sex life was not his or anyone else's business to be perfectly honest.

'Okay, it's just cleaning,' Snape thought. 'What could go wrong?'

Peeves the Poltergeist zipped in and poured a bucket of rancid milk over Snape's head The Potions Professor's lips curled into a snarl as that nasty poltergeist zipped off into the shadows laughing like a madman on speed. Snape would have loved nothing better than to take his wand and perform any number of creative curses to the Poltergeist. Only, he remembered, Dumbledore took his wand away.

'Damn you, Dumbledore!'</pre>

<pre>"What seems to be the problem here?" Iris chirped out happily, Dudley simply cocked his head to the side and stared the much older girl in the eye meeting her gaze evenly.

One of them snapped out, "Nothing that has to do with you Dursley, why don't you go knit a tea cozy or something?" Iris cocked her head back at that as if struck as Dudley winced, his followup shiver didn't go unnoticed by the group as his sister responded.

"I'm not allowed to knit anymore, giving me sharp stabbing implements in a boring environment is bad for everyone involved. Not really my fault honestly, some people just have really low pain thresholds..." That seemed to have the direct opposite effect of what she wanted, since rather than putting the group at ease they stared at her incredulously, eventually the oldest girl, apparently their spokesman replied.

"Wait...what?" Iris growled in frustration, these idiots were taking too long to talk to, she was reading about dragons and enjoying it but noooo they had to go and bully the annoying girl. Ugh.

"It doesn't matter, why are you bothering Miss Granger here?" One of the girls sneered at that as she flicked the still cowering girls ear, Dudley, through his aura could feel said girls seething rage boiling beneath the surface and silently applauded her ability to hide it.

"Does it matter? She's ugly, her parents are only dentists, and she's annoying, what is it to you Dursley?" Iris had enough, and incidentally so did her brother, sighing he turned to the small girl and met her anger laced gaze evenly as he spoke.

"Iris just Obi-Wan the stupid bints, I have better things to do," smirking in turn she cocked her head to assess the confused group then snorted to herself.

"Right-O then," extending her fore and middle finger she swept her hand across the group as she stated, "You will stop bullying your classmates."

As one the group sans Granger replied with "We will stop bullying our classmates," the brunette's eyes widened in shock turning to assess her assailants as they blankly stared at the smirking little redhead.

"You will feel shame for what you have done and reflect on what you've done in the past," after repeating her once again she made eye contact with the oldest girl as a malicious smirk curled up her lips. "And you'll forget to wear your knickers for the next week because you deserve the embarrassment, now move along."

"We'll move along," the girls chorused as they left the library, Dudley was snickering to himself as he turned to the now gaping Granger girl and sighed in frustration.

"Right, her, make her forget this and lets go sis, mum will understand why we skived off if we throw in the bit about the bullies, no need to tell her they weren't bullying us after all."

Before Iris could respond Granger quickly squeaked out, "You're a Jedi too?! Like me!?" And with that, his little sister met her best friend for life.</pre>

<pre>There was a dry coughing noise that drew her attention from her goal, stepping from the shadows was an incredibly old man. He was bald, had slightly glowing red eyes, and his smile exposed elongated teeth as he licked his lips in anticipation.

"Err...hi? Sorry you took offense to us not wanting candy but you know, don't talk to strangers and all that." The man tilted his head to the side a bit as if trying to figure out if she was serious or not, eventually he just shrugged as he approached a table covered in weird marks that hurt her...sanity to look at.

"You are an interesting one my little doll, normally when I bring girls in here they panic and make the process far more difficult then necessary." As he said this he pulled out what looked like a brass bowl and a long black knife, turning he smiled again, "I do hope you're willing to be more cooperative then my last meal. She struggled so much that she ruined herself, and I had such plans for that little doll too."

Ok. Things have officially gotten creepy, Iris decided to figure this out right quick, "Mister where is my brother?"

He smirked darkly at that while rubbing a clawed finger under his chin, "Oh I'm sure Rupert is having fun with him in his little hall of horrors, hopefully he doesn't make such a mess this time, getting viscera out of the carpet is rather tedious even with household charms."

Gritting her teeth at the prospect of Dudley being hurt she eventually spat out, "Mister are you a bad guy? That is evil?" He paused at that as he seemed to grope about for the right words to use on this strange child, eventually he took on a contemplative look before nodding.

"I suppose while my kind do need to feed I happen to take unnecessary extra steps in the process that others would dictate made me a 'bad guy', and I suppose the entire 'hunting down little girls to drink their blood' would make me evil, yes."

Iris smiled at that while nodding, good they were getting somewhere. "Soooo what you're saying is you are an evil bad guy who happens to be a vampire, who plans on hurting my brother and me?"

He blinked, "Err...yes that about sums it up." He took an involuntary step back as a Cheshire cat grin spread across the girls face and her eyes began to glow.

<pre>Harry scrunched up his lips to one side merely as an alternative to rolling his eyes, which he didn't think would go over well. With said lop-sided frown affixed, he shut his eyes, and tried to hear the sounds that had been produced by the book's author, Wu. Although he could hear it in his head, it still didn't sound right! It was incredibly frustrating. After a few moments of this struggle, he said, "Let me try something."

What this called for, he thought, was a cheat.

Harry flipped the book to one of the first pages, where it said all of the different sounds of the language, and showed their phonetic symbols (some of which he didn't really understand, but that wouldn't matter in a moment). In his mind, Harry assembled an array of sound symbols for each consonant, then went back and assembled a separate list of each vowel with every possible tone. Once these lists were carefully constructed, Harry went through and tapped each and every symbol in the book with his wand several times, making Wu pronounce the sound of it over and over again. It was with the voice of Wu's gradually more impatient pronunciations of the sounds that he filled the final column of his mental array. It was, he reflected, the first time that he had built a such a mental construct which incorporated human speech noises in a deliberate way, but it was otherwise not unlike the list of potions ingredients and their properties, or the array of classmates and what he knew about them, or any of the other such lists he had created. (Harry made a mental note to amend his list of personae dramatis to include their voices, which he now realized had not been properly cataloged.)

The next step was to create a tiny little mental program which simply assembled those speech-noises together into syllables, and then caused him to speak them.

This bit proved rather more tricky, since he had never before attempted to create a mental program which directly controlled his actions. It took him a while to figure out how to connect the mental result directly to his mouth, and somewhere in the middle of the process he thought it might be better, anyway, if he didn't cut his conscious mind out of it. However, this thought was easily thrown out when he realized that of course his conscious mind didn't have any direct influence on his pronunciation of English, either, and so he persevered.

Eventually, Harry opened his eyes, and was met by Hermione's worried brown eyes as she regarded him. "You've done it again, haven't you?" she asked.

Harry said, "Nĭ hăo … wǒ shì yīngguórén."

Hermione's eyes widened slightly. The portrait of Wu in Harry's book, which was shut, made a strange strangled noise. "Harry," Hermione sound delicately. "You sound like a Chinese robot."

Harry frowned at that. "Well, it needs some work," he admitted. "But the tones were right, werent they?"

"Er … I think? It was a bit distracting, hearing you speak like a robot. But yes, I think the tone was right. Well, it's just like I would expect a Chinese robot to sound like if it decided to say, 'hello, I'm an Englishman,' but that doesn't really seem like something a Chinese robot would say. Harry, are you all right?"

"It just needs a bit of smoothing," Harry said, waving his hand to display his lack of concern. He'd obviously continue working on the PronounceChinese program, which would eventually be converted into a class for a larger SpeakChinese program, for many years, so it was of little consequence that the very first version of it wasn't perfect. "Trust me, I know all about smoothing."

Hermione looked at him as though he were an anomalous specimen (which he rather was) and said, "Harry, I'm not sure if you can anti-alias human languages. It's not exactly like pixels on a computer screen."

"Just watch me," he said. "Or better yet, dare me."

Hermione shook her head in exasperation. "Well, I can't deny that it was an improvement from your earlier attempts," she admitted. "But … well, instead of listening to an Englishman speak Chinese like a beginner, I've just listened to an English-designed robot say, in perfect but odd Chinese, that it was an Englishman."

"An improvement," Harry agreed, ignoring the rest. "Let's get conversational," he added, settling himself in for what would be his first ever enjoyable Chinese group study session.</pre>

<pre>When it came time for Harry to do the assignment himself about an hour or so later, he excused himself from the group and ducked into the quiet study room. Having heard Hermione's advice for Wayne, he began by opening up Magical Draughts and Potions to the appendix that listed all Sixteen Laws of Transmigration and Tessellation. The Sixteen Laws were, in his opinion, misnamed, because many of the laws actually contained more than one, and sometimes as many as twelve, subsidiary rules. In all, the Sixteen Laws took three pages of the book, and it was a rather wide and tall book. He had looked over them more than once over the summer, but never with the intention of memorizing them. Looking at them much more closely than ever before, he realized that, taken as a whole, the Sixteen Laws were not entirely dissimilar to a class in programming. The metaphor was far from perfect, but immediately he saw that it was useful. Looking at each Law as though it were a method of a SixteenLaws class, and looking at each of its subrules as just a conditional statement within that method, Harry was slowly able to put together in his mind the class that they made up, and see how it all worked together. While some of the 'methods' referenced things he didn't quite understand yet, for now he didn't worry about that and just let those be 'black boxes' that just did what they did.

Now in a state of mind that came very close to meditative, he began to assemble the program that would make use of this class to actually make a potion.

Very quickly he realized that he needed a class for the ingredients, as well. The best design that he could come up with would be to simply make the Ingredient class inherit from the SixteenLaws class, and then have a bunch of variables whose values were specific to each different ingredient, which would then inform how the inherited methods from SixteenLaws worked.

Finally, there must be a class for the potion itself. The only important things about this class was that it contained an array of Ingredient objects and a method called AddIngredient.

So, bit by bit he pieced all of this together in mental pseudo-code until he thought he might have something that would actually work. In all, it took two or three hours. All of this he was able to store in his mind just as easily as he was able to store the definition of every method of every class in BitHeap – of course his BrewPotion pseudo-program was considerably simpler than BitHeap. So much simpler, in fact, that he felt no need to write anything down. Once he was pretty satisfied with it, he let it sort of settle and solidify in his mind. The problem now, he realized as he looked down at his blank sheet of parchment, was how to translate this into language that a wizard could understand.

Harry's first Potions assignment was only six inches of parchment, but in all it took him three hours to do, most of which were spent staring at the wall or just sitting there with his eyes closed. However, he was fully confident that he could use his new 'mental program' BrewPotion for the rest of his life, making patches along the way whenever he learned something new. So he was all smiles when he left the quiet study room, rejoined his fellow firsties, and let Hermione read over his assignment.</pre>

<pre>"Fucking Voldemort," he muttered.

Terry jumped in shock. Sonny stared at Harry in outrage and confusion and said, "Where do you get off?"

"Sorry," Harry said. Of course, he knew enough about this society to know that speaking the name of Voldemort, the guy who had in Terry's words traumatized the society, was a taboo. "I guess I should call him 'You-Fucking-Know-Who-I-Mean.'"

"That's hardly any better," Hermione chastised as the Ravenclaw boys had to laugh in spite of their previous outrage.</pre>

<pre>And of course, predictably, they had indeed seen a brand new Nintendo, complete with two controllers and several game cartridges, on Dudley's birthday. And, in order to make room for the new device, there had been no choice but to move Dudley's 'old computer,' although it was pristine and far from obsolete, into Harry's room.

And that evening, after Dudley's birthday festivities had drawn to a close, Harry connected the computer up, setting it up on the floor as he had no desk, and turned the machine on.

Somehow, he knew even at that early stage, that this moment would alter everything that follows.

The machine was confusing, and it was frustrating. It came with an owner's manual, and Harry needed to consult it constantly at first, just to do simple things. But within a few weeks he had already begun to make a computer game of his own.

Line by tedious line of code, he sketched out a text-based adventure game. Oh, it was poorly written, being written by an eight year old, but it worked, and it brought him endless satisfaction to tinker and toil all through the summer, fleshing out his little world, finding and squashing bugs. It was a simple game: you could type "east" to move east, and "west" to move west, and so on. And you could type in things like "attack deer" to do what you would expect that to do. And you would collect coins and trinkets and sell them back in town, and buy new equipment, and gain levels. And that was really about it – it was not complicated. Somehow he found it endlessly amusing anyway.</pre>

<pre>Riddle was in yet another rage. The casualty figures were worse now than they had been during the actual subjugation of the world. Fifty-three dead in Britain, nine thousand four hundred and 6 world wide, and that was only in the last twelve days. This Reaper was inspiring copy cats all over the world. Marked Purebloods were dying from everything from explosive traps to knives. Entire families had been found dead. Government officials from provincial Governors to the Janitorial staff were targeted. A whole squad of Aurors was lost to a pit trap with spikes lining the floor, like something from a Muggle motion picture he had seen in his youth.

Another report said that House Elves were rising up against their masters. That was insane, those beings had been slaves since before memory, yet now small groups of them were in rebellion. Elves captured and tortured until their resistance was broken routinely died, but before they did, a few (very few) had spoken of a rising 'Dark Elf' named Dobby who was to lead them to salvation.

Dark. Elf.

This was madness. House elves did not revolt. House elves did not attack wizards. This was all coming from this Reaper. He and his influence had to be stopped, no matter what the cost.</pre>

<pre>So Dobby, you know what it is I'm asking you to do, right?"

The little elf's ears flopped from his rapid nodding of his head. "Dobby knows, Harry Potter Sir. Harry Potter Sir would like to hire Dobby to snuff Dobby's evil bad former master, and evil bad former master's master, the Who-No-Poo wizards do not talk about." At the House Elf's name for the Bastard, Harry really struggled not to burst out laughing. It was a close thing.

"And then cover it up by putting 'loads of crap' so no one will be finding it out," Dobby finished his statement rather succinctly.</pre>

<pre>After Hermione and Ron got out, he calmed down, slightly. He still burst out in random bits of laughter here and there, doing more to his reputation as being completely insane than his walking around naked ever did. Luna suddenly walked up to him and asked him point blank, "Harry Potter, what did you do?"

She asked it the same way Professor McGonagall used to ask the same question to the Twins, and that was just too funny in and of itself simply because Harry knew that Luna didn't have a strict bone in her entire body. And so he told her, amidst laughter, "Ahahahaha! I, hahaha, I killed You-Know-Who, *snicker*, with a BOMB! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

Everybody around froze on the spot at those words. Half the school was holding it's breath, the other half were hyperventilating and well on their way to a full out panic attack.

"And the best part?" he laughed even louder, "Gah-hahaha! Guess who's house he was staying at? AAHahahaha! Oh man, Malfoy is going to be super pissed! I hope I'm there to see it!" He started howling with laughter at the very thought of the look on Malfoy's face.

"Harry... what have you done?" Hermione whispered, shocked.

He shrugged, down to constant chuckles now rather than uproarious laughter. "I did what I was raised to do, by Dumbledore. By the whole damned Wizarding World." He sat so he was more or less laying on the stairs behind him, "I killed Tom Marvolo Riddle, aka Lord Voldemort. With a bomb!" He started laughing again.

"I tried dueling for a while, and I once used a nuclear bomb. Never doing that again by the way. Finally just hit him with bomb after bomb after bomb. It was the Napalm one that finally got him it turned out."

"N-n-nuke... Wait, NAPALM?" Hermione suddenly screamed at him. "Harry, where was You-Know-Who hiding out?"

He shrugged, grinning widely, "Malfoy Manor."

"Harry... how did you know that? Aside from the obvious, I mean," Ron asked.

Harry shrugged and then looked about. Leaping to his feet, he went over and grabbed something out of a Fourth Year's hands and then called out, for the benefit of Hermione and a few others, "Accio water!" He didn't bother using his wand, but nobody made mention of it so he figured he was in the clear for the moment. Water came streaming in from the Great Hall and even down the stairs. The water all pooled in the ceramic bowl that apparently had been a Transfiguration project. Once the water had gathered, Harry kept it level and then put his hand over the water and whispered the scrying spell. Images appeared in the water and once they were there, Harry used his Water magic affinity to draw it out of the ceramic bowl and then expand it until everyone looking on could see it. It was an overhead aerial view of what remained of Malfoy Manor. The fires were still burning.

"Oh my God!" Hermione gasped, her hands going to her mouth.

Harry shrugged again, but he was no longer laughing.

"You've changed... everything Harry," Luna whispered, her eyes wider than normal, her tone filled with as much horror as Hermione's had been.

"Unfortunately... no, I haven't," he answered with a sigh, the depression starting to set in now that the high had started to ebb. "I'm stuck in a time loop. I'll wake up tomorrow morning and Voldemort will still be here. Snape too, by the way. But the Bastard, uh, the snake-faced bastard that is, was seriously getting on my nerves with his constant mental attacks. So... I got rid of him before he could attack me today. Much better than waiting till the end of the day in the Ministry."

"Harry... have you lost it mate?" Ron said, horrified. "How many people did you kill? Innocent people?"

"Two House Elves, Narcissa Malfoy, a snake named Nagini, and probably got a lot of people at that British Military base where I got all the parts from fired. Beyond that... none. As for Death Eaters and the dark creature calling itself Lord Voldemort? Well, I lost count of how many times I've killed all of them. But if you're talking bodies burning there? Hm... sixty three," he answered matter-of-factly.

"What is everyone doing lollygagging about?" Draco Malfoy stormed down the stairs and then stopped and stared at the image displayed on the water. He went even more pale than normal, and his eyes, if possible, went wider than Luna's ever did. His jaw dropped open and would probably be hanging somewhere down by his ankles if he could actually unhinge it.

Harry smiled and started laughing again. "There it is! Haha! So worth it! Wow, I so wish I could take a picture and frame this!"

"Oh, and Malfoy, congratulations! And, you're welcome," Harry added as a remark, slapping his school enemy on the back, probably harder than strictly necessary. "You're now Lord Malfoy. The last of your line to boot! All your dad's cash and responsibilities and everything that you relied on him to take care of for you? That's all yours now!"

Malfoy fainted on the spot.

"So worth it," Harry smiled and then dispelled the image of former site of Malfoy Manor.</pre>

<pre>Narcissa ran, fighting back tears of rage and frustration. Lucius was dead—her entire family was dead, and it was all Potter's fault. Only precious Scorpius had any hope for the future. As heavy as her grief was, so to was her hope and determination. She would raise her son to be a true champion of nobility and magic. He would be a Pureblood among Purebloods, and a wizard to make even the Dark Lord take note.

"Oh my little Scorpius," she said, "you shall make your father proud!"

She continued to rub her stomach as she ran, until without warning a silent Expelliarmus plucked her wand from her fingers and brought it spinning through the air to stop in a disillusioned hand. A moment later the figure undid the charm to reveal a girl of fifteen, with stringy blonde hair and distant gray-blue eyes. She smiled at Narcissa, and the expression reminded her of her Lord's smile.

"Hello, Mrs. Malfoy," Luna said. "How are you this evening?"

"You can't harm me!" Narcissa said, holding out a hand to stop the girl. "I'm pregnant!"

"And I'm psychopathic," Luna said happily. "Did you know that your son cast the entrails-expelling curse at me? While it was painful, it was not nearly as painful as I thought it would be, at least not at first. It turns out that you don't have many nerve clusters inside your intestines. The pain came after, and it was quite intense, I assure you."

"You can't harm me!" Narcissa said, tears streaming down her face. "You would be murdering an unborn child."

"If I were bothered by such things," Luna said, "I would point out to you that the unborn child in question would be a Malfoy. I have no doubt that you would raise the child to be just like Draco, or your dear husband Lucius. And that, someday, a girl like me, only likely one without a severe anti-social disorder, will likely get the pleasure of being raped or cursed by him. Therefore his death at this juncture would actually relieve him of the pain of my having to later hunt him down and kill him, and relieve all of his potential victims of the horrors he would inflict on them. I would point this out, if in fact I cared about such things."

Luna took a step forward, her distant smile becoming immediate and feral. "However, I don't care about such things. I owe the Malfoy family a gift. And I have come to give it to you. You should be grateful. This way, you will get to see your unborn child before you die ... Aesuomk'ak Aep T'akh."</pre>

<pre>Harry let his disillusionment charm drop and landed, shrinking his broom casually, while inside his heart thudded wildly. "Tom," he said with a nod. "How's Nagini?"

"Safe," Voldemort said.

In the distance, they heard a roar like a train and turned to see a pillar of white-hot fire which lasted only a little while. A moment later a young, female voice cried out, "Oh, I'm going to love my new boots!"

"Hmm," Harry said with a smile, "that would be Nagini. And that, Tom, was your last Horcrux."</pre>

<pre>As they settled in, all together this time, Ginny said, "Harry, I feel bad that I'm not more bothered by this. I mean, they were beaten."

Luna, who lay between them, said, "They chose their own fate. They were dead the moment they came into information we could not let them have. Realistically, I doubt Zeus would have allowed them to leave the castle alive."

Harry looked over Luna's head at Ginny. He knew Luna was incapable of regret, and would not feel anything different if the two dead students were perfectly innocent. But his wife— "You know, during Fourth Year after the World Cup, I walked up to the Slytherins. I told them if they ever joined Voldemort, I would kill them. I said I'd feel bad about it but I would kill them. And now every one of them except of Tracey is dead. Maybe Blaise—I can't remember if he was there or not."

"Do you think Draco ever really had a choice?" Ginny said.

"He did," Luna said with even certainty. "None of his choices were good, but they were choices. Ask Dumbledore for help and leave the country, or stay and fight for the light; or become a servant to darkness. It is unlikely he saw those choices, but they were there. Edgecombe and McLaggen had the same choices available, and made the same mistakes."

She turned to Harry, but then slid over him and out of bed. "You two need to have sex. It will make you feel better. I hope this will not impact my time this weekend."

"It won't," Harry and Ginny both promised.

The Ravenclaw nodded before padding naked back to her room. When she was gone, Ginny said, "Well, she is our Control. We'd better do what she says."</pre>

<pre>McGonagall, perhaps sensing his confusion, sighed deeply. "I discovered some things that were occurring in years past that Albus knew about, and allowed. Which brings us to you, Miss Lovegood, and your father."

"Oh," Ginny whispered, and Harry understood now too, why McGonagall was so angry.

"I have learned that you threatened to kill a fellow student in order to create a vacancy on the Gryffindor Quidditch team during Ginny's first year here. I have learned that for several years your roommates lived in such abject terror of you that they refused to inform anyone that you repeatedly threatened them not just with physical harm, but with the Cruciatus curse as well. Additionally, at some have admitted that you actually physically assaulted them, as well as cursed them. I have learned that you actually did assault Professor Snape, cutting off his fingers and his ear. For all the harm you have suffered in this school, Ms. Lovegood, you have caused so much more. I never, in my life, believed I would encounter a child so lacking in morals or even common humanity, as I find in you."

Luna's serene smile did not flicker at all, while Xenophilius frowned heavily. "And you," she said to the wizard, "I don't give a damned what your justification was; I don't give a damned who you are or what position you hold—it was nothing less than criminal to send that girl to Hogwarts! You knew very well how dangerous she was, and yet you sent her anyway. Worse yet, you have bound her to two of the best students this school has ever seen. You have tainted them and this school, with this amoral monster."

"She is not a monster!" Harry said, flashing anger in his magic.

"But I am, Harry," Luna said. "What I said in the train was true—I am your own personal Bellatrix. I am a monster, but if we are to win the Light needs a monster."

Harry settled back down into his seat. "Professor, she's a part of our team. I know she's not perfect, but she is ours."

McGonagall sighed, leaning back in her chair after placing her tea cup back on its saucer and onto the serving tray. "Hence the point of this conversation, Harry. Professor Flitwick, after finally discovering what has happened, has resolutely refused to allow Luna back into the girl's dorms. He feels, with ample justification, that she represents a danger to all other students in Ravenclaw."

Ginny was the first to see it. "She'll live with us, then. She already was doing so at the end of the summer. We're adults now, so you don't need parental consent for us to cohabitate, and Xeno's the reason we're together in the first place, so you know he'll consent."

McGonagall pursed her lips. "It is wildly inappropriate for such a relationship to exist within these halls."

Luna cleared her throat. "I assure you, Professor, we are not the first, nor were such relations limited to just the student body."

"Ms. Lovegood, you are not aiding your case," McGonagall said.

"There is no case to aid, Headmistress. You have already decided to permit it, and I do thank you for that. Harry and Ginny are my anchors, and I would be quite lost without them. What you seek is assurance that we will not flaunt our non-traditional relationship or otherwise embarrass the school."

McGonagall's eyes narrowed. "That would be my expectation."

"We will not do anything to embarrass the school or you, Professor," Harry said. "You have always been the one bastion of fairness here, and I would hate to disappoint you in any way."</pre>

<pre>"Oh Merlin," Molly said, paling visibly and wringing her hands as she immediately began to understand. "They didn't…"

Ginny looked her father in the face. "They did. They tried to get him to make the marriage vow—just like Fleur did during the Triwizard Tournament. They were using my face, Daddy. And now he can't even stand to look at me…"

Molly, compelled by the horror of seeing her only daughter crying in anguish, rushed forward to embrace her, but Ginny spun away from the rush so adroitly Molly for a moment couldn't even see where she'd gone. Ginny jumped from the porch, using a banishing charm to propel herself into the air, and a cushioning charm to land in a dead run toward the plumes of smoke.

"Ginny!" Molly howled, starting after her.

"Molly, stop," Arthur barked in a voice of command he'd never used with her before. She pulled up, angry and incredulous that he would use that tone with her.

Arthur shook his head before stepping down to hug her. "I'm sorry, Molly, but we need to let her go. She's the only one who can fix this."

Ginny didn't not hear any of it. She ran toward yet another plume of dust, ignoring the ear-numbing explosion that caused it, and saw him standing there in the midst of a moonscape of craters. His face was a ragged mask of snot and tears; with a mask of dirt and dust covering it from his efforts.

She did not slow at all—instead she tackled him head-on, throwing both to the ground as she straddled him. "STOP IT!" she screamed.

He stared up at her with narrowed eyes, his lips compressed into a thin line. The air around them shimmered with his magic. It spiked angrily until it felt like her skin was on fire, but she did not let go of him. "Just stop it," she said again as tears ran down her nose. "I can't handle this anymore, Harry. I need you back!"

"They ruined me, Ginny," he choked out.

"No they didn't!" she said. She grabbed his filthy face in her hands and locked eyes with him. "You are mine, Harry! I don't give a damn what they did, or what you did, you are mine! Do you hear me? I want my Harry back!"

She felt his magic spiking again as pain and anguish washed through him. "You don't understand…" he said, a new river of tears streaking through the dust. "What they made me do…"

"Then make understand, baby," she said, crying anew. "Tell me what happened."

"You'll hate me." It came out as a choked whisper, and in that instant Ginny did not hear the nearly sixteen-year old boy who loved her; she heard a child, terrified and broken.

She reared back, still straddling him, and looked down as he turned his face away from her. Silently, she conjured a face cloth and water, and then leaned back over him as she gently rubbed away the dirt, dust, snot and tears. Gently, she pulled his face around to get the other side, until he was mostly clean. "Harry," she said, in a tone she remembered her mother using with her when she was a little girl, "you could murder the whole world, and I would still love you. There is nothing you could do, ever, to make me not love you. You're my whole world, Harry. You're my everything."

"I cheated on you," he said, choking on the word.

"Oh baby," she said, pulling him up and holding his head to her chest. "Oh Merlin, Harry, you didn't cheat on me. You didn't. It wasn't your fault."

"It was," he moaned, agonized, into her bosom. "I escaped—I broke their allure and burned the potion out of my body, and I could have stunned her. But I was so mad, I wanted to hurt her. I wanted to hurt her, Ginny! I…I fucked her like some kind of animal, and I did it because I wanted to hurt her."

This was not in any of the reports; this is not something she'd heard. She leaned back, still clasping his face, and said, "Tell me, Harry. Tell me everything."

And so he did, unable to hide it from her any longer. Shaking at the memory, he told her not just about the potion-induced rapes by a woman who looked and sounded just like Ginny, but also at the end, when he gave in to his own anger and shame. By the end, he was crying just as much as she was, and the two were sitting with their foreheads touching, her on his lap and her arms around his neck.

"I'm so sorry," he gasped, choking on his own tears now, she held him. "Oh God, I'm so sorry, Ginny."

She didn't say a word; instead she just pulled his head to her chest again, rocking gently and crooning just like her mother did for her when she was hurt as a child. Around them, she saw the deep craters he'd gouged in his rage, and felt a strange, oddly-timed knot of gratefulness that he hadn't taken his anger out on the trees in the apple orchard. They sold the apples every year in the village for extra money, and the ritual of picking and packing the apples was one of her fondest, most beloved memories.

And then something suddenly dawned on her, making her cheeks blush. She leaned back, cradling Harry's head still. His cheeks were blotched and reddened and his glasses were askew. "Harry," she said, "did you really fuck a Veela unconscious?" she finally said.

He stared, jaws agape. For a moment, sheer surprise overcame emotion. "That's all you have to say?"

"Harry, I…" She stopped and shook her head. "Love, you didn't ask to be there, and you most certainly didn't start that last bout. You said she came to you and started it. But Merlin's beard it sounds like you finished it."

Harry shook his head, confused and a little hurt. "Ginny, you don't understand…"

Her eyes narrowed as she looked at him, and then she leaned down and kissed him with all the passion two months of withdrawal could create. She let her own magic go, feeling it reach for and sooth the ragged ends of his own. "Show me," she finally said. "Show me what you did to her."

"Ginny! I don't want to hurt you! I don't ever want to do something like that in anger again."

She reached down and started fumbling for his belt. "Then don't, Harry. It's not anger I'm feeling right now. I want to make love to my man—it's been a damned long, painful two months, and you just told me you fucked a Veela into a coma. You are going to have sex with me, or I'm going to hex you into next week!"

"But what about your parents?"

"I don't care!" she screamed, before kissing him again. "Harry, I love you so much. I need you. You…are…mine!"

Looking into her eyes, he realized with a shock that he saw the same sense of possession for him that he felt for her when he burned away the confounding potion, the same anger that anyone would dare take him away from her. His hands shook when he started taking off her jumper and pulling down her trousers. They didn't even bother with a cushioning charm on the ground. His magic flared, and like in Bulgaria he pushed at it, pushed at her with it. Her cheeks flushed, as did her chest, as he penetrated.

"Oh my God," she gasped. "Oh God, Harry!"

It was not like their first time at all. Harry moved urgently underneath her, gripping her hips and pulling her down with all his strength, but there was no anger at all. With her magic meshing so perfectly with his, he could not even think about the Veela. All he could think about was how perfect his Ginny was for him; all she could think about was…well, not much, and she was okay with that.

~~Unspeakable~~

~~Unspeakable~~

Molly couldn't leave the porch. None of them could, really, but at least the boys made a pretense of doing something. Ron and Fred started a chess game while George watched. Arthur went back inside, probably to read or just relax.

Molly could not do that, though, not when two of her kids were out there hurting so badly. At least the explosions had stopped. It frightened her to think that Harry was so powerful he could do that. When she moved to the very edge of the porch, she could see them out beyond the orchard trees. She narrowed her eyes and saw Ginny on Harry's lap, holding his head to her chest.

She struggled to breathe, and wrung her hands. A part of her wanted to run out and sweep them both in big hugs, but she was hesitant to do that after Arthur asked her to stay. This was not to say that Arthur had any business bossing her around or using that tone with her, and she'd make sure he knew it! But she knew sometimes she was too motherly to her children—she knew why Bill and Charlie left so fast after finishing Hogwarts, and tried her best not to smother the other kids. It was so hard, though, and things were so frightening…and oh Merlin was Ginny taking off her clothes?

She stopped wringing her hands and stared, incredulous, as her fourteen, almost fifteen-year-old daughter started bouncing on Harry. "Arthur! ARTHUR!"

The boys ran to her side, alerted to her voice, and immediately saw what was happening. Molly desperately tried to cover Ron's eyes, which made the twins snort. Arthur came barreling out of the house with his shirt undone. "What is it?" he asked.

She raised one shaking hand, while trying to keep the other over Ron's eyes. Of course, Ron had moved her hand while she wasn't looking and looked himself. Arthur joined them, squinting before he cast a far-seeing spell.

"Oh my!" he said, flushing to his scalp.

"You have to stop them!" Molly screamed.

"Little late for that, mum," Fred said.

"Looks like they're about done anyway," George said.

"No, they started again," Ron said. "Wow, that training of theirs really paid off."

"Ron!" Molly screamed, horrified, while the twins laughed.

"Weasleys!" Arthur snapped. "Inside, now. Now, boys."

The three boys walked into the house, laughing and shaking their heads in astonishment at their sister's precociousness. "Arthur, we have to stop this!" Molly screamed. "Look what he's doing to our little girl!"

"Molly, our little girl was on top," Arthur pointed out, before coughing when he realized exactly what it was he just said. "Molly…this isn't their first time."

"WHAT?"

He winced, and then took a deep breath. "They as much as admitted they were intimate the night before Harry's cleansing ritual—you know, the one that led to him being dead for five minutes?"

Molly gasped, and then turned away, covering her face. "Arthur, she's too young! She can't be doing this! It's all that horrid Lovegood's fault."

"It likely is," Arthur said, "but it's too late now. We cannot change who or what they are. And think about this, Molly. An entire colony of Veela, using Polyjuice and confounding potion, could not make Harry renounce his love for our daughter. And Ginny was able to complete the True Love's Kiss potion. After all that, can you even doubt that they love each other?"

She spun around, face red. "She's fourteen years old!"

"She'll be fifteen in two weeks, Molly. How old were you your first time?"

"That's different!"

Arthur struggled to control his anger—he couldn't believe he was defending his daughter having sex at fourteen. "How is it different, Molly? Other than the fact that you did not stay with the boy for long, whereas Ginny and Harry are bound for life?"

"You can't know that," Molly said, losing some of her volume and steam.

"I will stake my life on it," Arthur assured her. "Please, Molly, let me handle this. I know you mean well, but I need to handle this. Please."

"You owe me," Molly said, sniffing. "You owe me the nicest dinner in England."

"Love, I owe you everything good in my life," he said as he leaned over and kissed her. "As much as those two love each other, I love you even more. Just this once, let me handle things."

Unable to speak, she rushed inside. A moment later, Ron wandered out of the house. In the distance, Harry and Ginny were no longer moving. "All of Gryffindor knows," Ron said. "They know Harry and Ginny never came back to their dorms after their last test. Seamus started to make a joke about it, until Hermione hexed him and threatened the whole house."

Arthur took a deep, ragged sigh. "And Luna was with them."

Ron shrugged. "That I wasn't going to say anything about. But the three of them are always together."

In the distance, Harry and Ginny were laying down on the ground, unmoving.

"I hope, someday," Ron said softly, "that Hermione and I love each other half as much as those two do. I hope, anyway."

Arthur gripped his youngest son's shoulder. "You've grown up a great deal, Ron. You've become a good man. I'm proud of you."

Ron's cheeks flushed and he looked down. "Thanks, Dad."

"And I'm going to need you on my side, because your mother may end up killing us all." With that, Arthur started down the porch steps, walking toward the lovers in the distance.</pre>

<pre>Ginny settled onto the seat beside Harry, close enough that their legs touched. "They've been doing that all day," she said.

Harry, who was trying his hardest to ignore the blatant stares not just of his housemates, but of much of the student population, nodded to himself. Across from them, Ron snorted. "What'd you expect, Harry? You kicked Malfoy's arse!"

"Language, Ron!" Hermione said absently. She had a large, dusty tome open and was pouring over it religiously.

Harry, Ginny and Ron looked up as Luna sat down next to Hermione, draped her arm around the older girl's shoulders as if they were best friends, and whispered, "It's on page 679, Fourth paragraph."

Such was Hermione's slavish attention to the book, and the speed and silence with which Luna moved that Hermione did not realize what was happening until Luna's lips were whispering into her ears. She screeched and jumped back into Ron while the rest of the table—and Harry and Ginny especially—tried not to laugh. "Luna!" Hermione said, struggling to regain her composure. "What are you doing here?"

"Fortunately, Harry's adventures this morning and lunch helped Professor Flitwick to forget my own detention."

"You got a detention?" Ron asked her. "Why?"

"Well, you see…"

"It's okay, Ron," Harry said, while Ginny said, "Luna, please, it's okay."

Hermione narrowed her eyes and looked amongst her friends suspiciously. "What's that about, then?"

"Luna will be glad to tell you," Harry said, and Ginny again added, "But you really, really don't want to know."

"Merlin, why is everyone so repressed? I was just masturbating," Luna said casually as she picked a pastry off Hermione's plate.

Ron turned a bright red, and Harry worried his friend was about to pass out again.

Somehow, it did not surprise him that Snape turned a corner and led them into a wall of twelve Death Eaters. Harry and Ginny raised their shields the moment the Death Eaters cast. Their magic was so closely entwined that instead of two magical shields, they created a single, larger shield that was able to hold off all twelve curses. Of course, Harry admitted to himself the curses were not meant to kill, but incapacitate.

Snape turned and stood with the Death Eaters, a sneer on his face and a curse on his lips.

Harry and Ginny looked at one another a moment before a wash of killing-green magic flared behind them and flew a foot from Harry's arm into a stunned Death Eater. "No restrictions," Luna's voice called from the air.

Harry looked at Snape, and calmly said, "Avada Kedavra!"

His killing curse streaked toward the stunned professor, who did not have time to conjure anything to block it. Instead, the selfish man levitated another of the Death Eaters into the curse before he turned on his heel and ran. The remaining Death Eaters, realizing the teens were holding back nothing, did the same. Ginny transfigured a wall to block the killing curses while Harry conjured a shower of darts that Ginny then banished toward the enemy.</pre>

<pre>Finally they reached the headmaster's office and headed up. Dumbledore was there, as always, sitting serenely behind his desk as if he had spent his whole life waiting for this day. "Ahh, Harry, Severus, what can I do for the two of you today?"

"Mr. Potter saw fit to challenge me in class; he hexed another student without provocation; and then had the gall to threaten me with the DMLE!"

"Well, Mr. Potter, what do you have to say for yourself?" Dumbledore said.

"I'm guilty, better expel me," Harry said with forced calm. "In fact, I'm also feeling an urge to assault a professor, so add that to the mix. You might actually have to have Aurors come and arrest me for assault."

Snape snorted. "Always acting the…aaarrrgggh!"

Before the Potions Master started his fourth word, Harry dropped to a kneeling position and swung back his elbow with as much non-magical force as he could muster, right into Snape's groin. He then reached up, grabbed Snape by his greasy hair, and flipped him over his shoulder.

The man doubled over, clutching his crotch and groaning in agony. Harry straightened and was not surprised to see Dumbledore unmoved, watching with that damnable twinkle in his eyes. "That's for teaching Malfoy the entrails-expelling curse, you greasy-haired bastard." He stood and wiped his hands on his pants, while grinning angrily at Dumbledore. "Oops, looks like I assaulted a professor. Better expel me for sure, now."

"Feel better, Mr. Potter?" Dumbledore asked.

"I don't know, I'm feeling a few homicidal tendencies coming on too."

Between Snape's groans, Dumbledore said, "Severus, please go see Madame Pomfrey for a pain potion if you would. It's been long time since Mr. Potter and I had a talk."

"Albus, he struck me right in front of you!" Snape virtually screamed.

"And your entire house shot illegal curses at me in your class, including some that would undoubtedly include jail time," Harry said. "I'm tired of playing your games. If you're going to honestly believe I don't know what the hell an entrails-expelling curse is then you're as big an idiot as Sirius believed." He turned to Dumbledore. "And if you think I or others can't get word out that you allowed Snape to have his entire house toss dark curses at me, then you, Sir, have finally fallen into your dotage."

The serene smile broke somewhat. "Severus, leave us," Dumbledore said in an unusually commanding tone. Grimacing with rage and pain, Snape picked himself off the ground and left the room, walking with decided care.

"So it comes to this," Dumbledore said. "Tell me, Mr. Potter, do you have a headache?"

Harry fought with all his will not to tremble as he faced this twisted, but admittedly powerful wizard. "You know I do. You're feeling it too."

"Yes, though I admit I'm surprised. Originally, I was going to plan our mutual deaths so that neither one of us would have to suffer through the sheer tedium of clashing magical auras. Unfortunately, your friends in the Department of Mysteries decided they knew better than the most powerful wizard alive how to raise a Sport."

Harry stared incredulously at the man. "Raise me? You…you…bloody, arrogant git! You gave me to Muggles who hated me! They beat me and treated me like a fucking animal! Anyone with half a brain knows more than you how to raise a Sport!" He caught himself when he realized he was screaming, having lost all self-control. It took a deep breath and an exercise in Occlumency to gain even a semblance of his normal tone. "One more year, headmaster. You keep doing everything in your power to make me hate you, and I just can't understand why. What do you have to gain from my hating you? Why do you lavish as much attention on Malfoy as me? Why does it seem like you care more about evil than you do light?"

He was expecting Dumbledore to slam his hands on his desk and rise up and shout; he was at least expecting the headmaster to flare his aura in a threatening manner. Instead, Dumbledore simply sat in silence and stared at Harry for the longest time. Finally he leaned forward and said, "Harry, do you really think Draco's life is any less important than yours?"

Harry blinked, thought it over for a moment, and then said, "Yes, I do. He's the son of a Death Eater, is probably a Death Eater himself, and knowingly cast a lethal curse at me that the shield I was under orders to use could not stop. He tried to murder me today, probably because Snape told him so, but that doesn't matter. He still tried to murder me today. And we both know it was he who Imperiused and assaulted Luna a couple of years ago. So, yes, I do think my life is worth more than his."

"Do you think, Harry, you could murder Draco Malfoy?"

"Murder? No. Kill…" Harry took a deep breath. "We both know I've killed before. We both know I'll have to kill again. It's really easy to die for your cause, Professor. It's even easier to make other people die for your cause. It's offensive to me that you ask that question, when the real question is why you weren't willing to kill Voldemort? Or Grindelwald before him?"

Dumbledore paled, showing an open response for the first time since the conversation began. "How could you…?"

"I have a support structure in place, Professor. I'm no longer the abused, clueless boy I was. I won't pretend I know everything, but it would not be wise to continue to proceed as if I know nothing. So answer me this—why? What could you possibly hope to gain by making me and those behind me your enemies? Sports aren't impervious—they've been killed before. And frankly, professor, I think my life is worth more than yours as well. And some very, very powerful people agree with me."

Very quietly, in a voice just above a whisper, Dumbledore said, "I owe you no explanation. I did what I must."

Harry cocked his head to one side, studying the stony face of a man he once worshipped as a god. "Then I owe you the same, and I will also do what I must. The next time Snape intentionally puts me in harm's way, I will kill him. The next time Malfoy uses a lethal curse on me or mine, I will make him pay. I will kill every child of every Death Eater in this school if it comes down to a choice between them or my people, and I suspect, deep down, you know I will. I won't enjoy it—Merlin knows that. But I'll do it. Because unlike others, I have the courage to truly do what it takes to win."

Harry stood and left the office, waiting for Dumbledore to call him. He barely made it to the door when he heard a voice said, "Detention, Mr. Potter. See Professor McGonagall at 8 p.m."

At least, Harry thought, he'd had the sense to send him to McGonagall and not Snape. "Very well, Professor."

With that, the door opened and Harry left the room.


Once he left the headmaster's tower, he saw it was fast approaching lunch. Though his stomach was in knots over a conversation that went much different than he thought it would, he still forced himself to walk straight with his shoulders thrown back. It was the look of confidence, Adonis told him. It was a way of using one's body language to project danger and confidence at the same time. Sometimes, the older man said, the right approach could stop a fight before it even began.

Unfortunately for Harry, by the time he reached the Great Hall, Malfoy was just returning from the Hospital Wing. Harry was walking through the doors, having caught sight of Ginny, Hermione and Ron, when he felt a brush of buzzing in the sub-audible range. No, it wasn't even hearing. He realized it was a similar feeling to the pressure he felt when he was close to Dumbledore. It was the feeling of magic approaching his aura.

"Harry!" he heard Luna's voice warn from his left.

Harry ducked and spun about while bringing his wand up to produce not a full Protego, but a smaller, rounded shield called a Parma barely visible to the naked eye, with which he batted the offensive curse away. He didn't see exactly what the spell was, but he had no doubt it would have hurt.

"You think you're so good, Potter!" Malfoy said, spitting his name. "So brilliant? Boy Who Lived? You sent my dad to Azkaban you half-blooded bastard!"

"Your dad is a filthy Death Eater. He's right where he belongs," Harry snapped back.

"Damn you, Potter!" Malfoy screamed. "Sectumsempra!"

Harry burst forward while throwing up another Aegis shield, this one angled at Crabbe. The larger boy cried out in pain as Malfoy's magic bounced off Harry's shield and shredded into his body like a massive cheese grater. Malfoy and Goyle both looked at their fallen comrade in horror before Harry dropped the shield a moment before grabbing Malfoy's wand-wrist. He spun under the startled Pureblood's arm but continued to hold the wrist, forcing the arm behind the taller boy's back.

With a down-thrust of his elbow, Harry snapped Malfoy's arm with a sickening crack. Before Malfoy could even scream Harry released the broken arm and grabbed the Slytherin's other, snapping it just as quickly. He followed with a leg-sweep that landed Malfoy on the floor and only then did the Slytherin begin screaming in pain.

After the initial moment of shock wore off, Goyle jumped to his friend's defense, only to receive a magic-driven kick to the chest that sent him flying back against the wall, where he slid to the floor and lay still. The whole fight took less than a minute.

Harry surveyed the three fallen boys with a numb feeling before he turned and saw Professor McGonagall and most of the Great Hall staring at him in shock.

"Mr. Potter!" McGonagall said, aghast.

"Bloody 'ell," Ron said around a mouth full of food.

"Can I kick Draco too?" Luna said with a happy hop and a little clap of delight.</pre>

<pre>"So, I'm dying to know who the other fifth year prefect is!" Hermione announced, changing course abruptly. "Is it you, Harry?"

Harry snorted, while Ron flushed and looked down at his twiddling thumbs. "Er, no, it's me, Hermione."

"Oh." Hermione blinked in surprise, and then tried to recover herself. "Well, that's wonderful news, Ron! I hope you set a good example for the first years. The prefect's meeting is going to start in about an hour. I…I supposed I was just expecting…"

Ron shrugged. "Yeah, me too."

Hermione felt a grin spreading across her face. "So, Ginny, you're fourteen now."

Ginny stared at her for a moment before her own grin appeared. "Yes, I am."

"Anything I should know about?"

"Yes, Harry's dating Luna."

Ron choked on spit while Hermione stared. She then started laughing hard, thinking Ginny was pulling her leg, and continued laughing right up to the point that Luna stood, leaned over, and gave Harry the most sensuous, passionate kiss Hermione had ever seen in real life. Not even her parents kissed like that.

Harry and Ginny scooted over and Luna sat on his other side before she casually resumed reading the Quibbler. The entire time, Ginny kept her hand on Harry's knee. Hermione felt her cheeks blooming. "That's, uh, nice."

"Harry," Ginny said in a conspiratorial whisper, "I think we broke Ron."

Hermione turned and indeed noticed Ron staring slack-jawed. A moment later, he blushed so hard he turned puce, got up and left the cabin. Hermione snickered. "That was mean, Harry."

Ginny laughed. "And Ron should have known better. Yes, we're officially a couple."

"And you let Luna kiss him like that?"

Luna looked up at last from her paper and fixed Hermione with a steady stare. "Are you upset because you wish to kiss him too?"

"What?" Hermione's cheeks blossomed a bright red. "No, for goodness sake!"

"Too bad," Luna murmured. "Then Harry could say he got a good snog from three girls all in the same cabin."

"I'll have you know that I have no desire to kiss Harry Potter," Hermione declared.

"That's good, because I don't intend to share," Ginny declared as she took Harry's hand.

Hermione could not help but notice a brief tightening around Luna's mouth. "What about Luna's kiss?"

Ginny gave the blonde Ravenclaw a long look. "Hermione, you know Luna. Can you imagine what she'd do to me if I didn't let her snog him once in a while? We're a team, all three of us."

The crease around Luna's lips seemed to relax. "Does that mean sharing Harry?" Hermione asked, sensing there was more going on between the three of them than they wanted to admit.

"Within reason," Ginny said after a long, thoughtful pause.</pre>

<pre>Somehow he managed to hold onto his wand through everything. He looked up in time to see Voldemort flowing toward him like a ball of black and white smoke. The dark lord grinned madly at him, clearly pleased by the mayhem. "Ahh, what a brilliant boy you are, Harry!" he said. "What a shame I cannot let you live! Avada Kedavra!"

It was pure instinct that caused Harry to flick his wand up and scream the killing curse himself. Voldemort's red eyes widened in surprise as two surges of green death slammed into each other. The resulting explosion sent Harry, Voldemort and all the Death Eaters flying back on the crest of a magical concussion wave that flattened the gravestones and shattered the glass in the manor house nearby.

+

In the middle of the fight, the Dark Lord's red eyes narrowed, and from his hiding place Harry felt a sudden, driving spike of pain deep in his skull, as if someone drove an ice-pick through his scar. There you are, a hissing voice said in Parsletongue.

With a startled cry Harry felt himself picked up and flung into the air. The violence of his motion shook loose his invisibility cloak. He spun around, realizing he was caught in a powerful summoning charm, and saw Voldemort's wand flashing green. Desperately, Harry launched his own killing curse, surprised at how easy it was to truly wish this man dead. As before, the two spells collided in midair, and the explosion caught Harry before he could land and flung him back.

He landed wrong on his left leg and felt the bone snap, but everything else already hurt so much it did little more than add another not to an ongoing symphony. He put his wand to his leg for the bone-mending charm, but felt it take poorly—not a clean break, then. Still, he would be able to walk, however painfully.</pre>

<pre>"Come to gloat, Potter?" a voice spat behind him.

Harry turned and looked at Draco. The young boy had his wand out and pointed right at Harry.

He shook his head. "No. I wanted to check on them, see if they were okay. It looks like they're surrounded by friends so there's no need for me to go in there."

"Oh, you should!" Draco said loudly, ensuring everyone around them could hear. "I think you should come in and ask Crabbe and Goyle how they are doing. Please, allow me!"

He opened the door to the cabin and the other Slytherins looked up in surprise. "Boys!" Draco said with a feigned air of excitement, "Guess who came for a visit? Why look, it's Harry Potter! Doesn't that make you feel better?"

"Stop it, Draco," Greengrass said.

"I didn't come to fight," Harry said softly. He looked at the two larger boys. "I lost my parents. I know what it's like. I guess…I guess I came to say I'm sorry."

"Ohhhh that makes it all better then, doesn't it?" Draco crowed. "Why, just come in and say you're sorry that your blood traitor godfather killed their fathers! Or that you put my father in Azkaban."

"No," Harry said, surprising himself and the others by the steel in his voice. "I'm not sorry Sirius killed them. They wore stupid masks and were killing innocent people. I watched them kill a young witch just a few years older than Daphne there right before my eyes. They all deserved to die. Just like any who support them."

The cabin went very, very quiet. In that silence, Harry turned to the two boys. "But you two didn't deserve to have to lose your fathers. I'm not sorry they died. But I am sorry for your loss."

"Get out, you bastard," Draco hissed.

"Yes, I should go," Harry agreed. He paused as he turned, and looked back into the cabin. "You should know that if Voldemort does come back, we won't play around this time. Minister Bones won't toss about stunners and throw Death Eaters in jail. The light side will hunt them down like the dogs they are and kill them on sight. Voldemort may return, but he'll find his army gone. I hope you remember that ... Because someday, I'm going to be one of those hunters. And if I ever find any of you with a dark mark on your arm, I will kill you. I'll feel bad about it, but you'll still be dead."

With that, Harry turned and left the cabin. He felt no better than before, and questioned why he went in the first place.

+

Things started to settle down as life went on. It did take quite a bit of convincing before Ron believed Harry didn't enter his name, until finally Ginny had words with him. By words, that is to say she kicked his shin repeatedly until he believed her. That was a typical Weasley conversation anyway, and it worked well enough.</pre>

<pre>That's when the Bludger went insane.

He pulled out of a dive that gave Ginny a clear path to a new goal when he heard Fred shout a warning. He saw the Bludger flying right toward his head and did a last minute sloth roll to avoid it. The ball passed by so quickly he could feel the breeze of its passage.

He resumed his position on the broom and started searching for the snitch in earnest. However, this time Ginny yelled at him and he saw the same Bludger had somehow turned around on its own and was coming right back toward him. Alarmed, he shot off at speed. He glanced behind him and felt his stomach drop. The Bludger was following him. He went through a wild range of moves, but the Bludger stayed on his tail. In fact, it started to gain on him. He needed some way to slow it down.

He spotted Malfoy on the edge of his vision, laughing at his plight.

Well, it would slow the Bludger down, Harry decided.

He turned toward Malfoy, but at the same time slowed a little until the Bludger was right on the bristles of his broom. "Malfoy!" he shouted. "Watch out!"

Cursing right back at him, Malfoy drifted his broom a few inches to the right. Harry skimmed an inch past the startled Slytherin seeker, and then spun into a curve. Malfoy followed his movement with his eyes, shouting at him for being an idiot, and did not see the Bludger until it slammed into his head and sent the Slytherin careening into the pitch.

The Bludger was back on Harry's tail just moments later as he made a line toward the Slytherin keeper. "Bletchley!" he shouted. "Watch out!"

Just like he did with Malfoy, he passed within an inch of the Slytherin beater with the rogue Bludger on his tail. The Bludger slammed into Bletchley's chest and sent the boy tumbling from his broom through one of the goals.

By now the spectators realized something was seriously wrong with the Bludger, and realized equally that Harry seemed to be using it as a weapon of mass destruction. Fearing for the safety of his team, Flint ordered his other players to stay away from Harry while the Gryffindor chasers began scoring with impunity.

Still, the Bludger would not stop. Harry finally flew toward the Professor's box. "Professor Dumbledore," he shouted. "Could you do something about this Bludger before it kills somebody?"

He soared past, and with a twinkling eye Dumbledore flicked his wand. The Bludger exploded. Harry flew up and away from the Bludger's violent demise, right into the snitch.

"Huh," he said, genuinely surprised, "Didn't even see you."

Thus Harry maintained his perfect record.

He flew back down in time to see Flint shouting at Ado…Professor Lockhart while Draco stared in horror at his arm. The arm hung limply, like a long piece of rubber. His face also bore a quickly darkening bruise on the right side.

"You did this!" Malfoy screamed when he saw Potter. "You charmed that Bludger! You made it hit me!"

"What are you talking about?" Harry said as he landed. Immediately all his teammates landed around him, with Ginny by his side. "I told you to watch out. Didn't you hear me?"

"Now, I'm sure I can fix this," Professor Lockhart said.

"Point that wand again at my student and I shall make you eat it," Professor Snape growled as he arrived. "Flint, get him to the hospital wing." He spun to Potter. "I know exactly what you did, Potter. I will see you expelled for this!"

"I told him and Bletchley to watch out," Harry said again, "Yelled it at the top of my lungs. Not my fault they didn't move."

"Indeed," Dumbledore said as the headmaster arrived. "I heard him quite clearly, Professor Snape. And, while Harry's marks have improved tremendously, stripping the charms from a Bludger to make it follow him is simply beyond a second year's abilities. Or do you feel he is good enough to accomplish such a task?"

Snape snorted. "The boy can barely write in the English language. Very well, but we will be watching."</pre>

<pre>He looked over at where Ginny and Luna were talking quietly. "Maybe we can start studying together again. But Ron's going to have to accept that Ginny is a part of it, and maybe Luna Lovegood as well."

"Lovegood?" Hermione blinked in surprise. "Harry, I've heard some strange things about her, and they're not nice at all. Her roommates are absolutely terrified of her."

Harry nodded. "I've never met anyone more dangerous," he agreed.

Hermione stared at him in concern. "You're joking?"

"No, I'm not," Harry said sombrely. "Whatever rumours you heard were probably true. And yet I think she would take a killing curse for Ginny and I. She's like our own Walsingham."

Hermione looked back over her shoulder at the other girls, and then studied Harry very closely. "I'm not sure what concerns me more, Harry. That you acknowledge she's dangerous and compare her to one of the most ruthless spymasters in English history or that you even know who Walsingham is to begin with. The Harry I knew last year wouldn't know that."</pre>

<pre>Their morning routine with Luna was the strangest part of their training to date. On the first day, Luna somehow got into the Gryffindor dorms and entered Harry's room. She crawled into bed with Harry, dressed in flowing cotton pants and a shirt that could have been a sweat suit if not for the magical style of tailoring, and simply lay next to him.

Harry opened his eyes to find a pair of blue-silver eyes staring right back. He bit back a startled yelp and sat up to look at his roommates. As it was still dark, they were all sound asleep. "Luna, how did you get in here?"

"Through the doors, silly," she said without smiling.

"Why are you here?"

"You need to get up for morning Yoga. Ginny is downstairs."

Harry nodded and sat up, but then blushed as he noticed he was only in his . He looked up at Luna and saw she was looking at him without expression. "Luna?"

"Yes, Harry?"

"Are you…happy?"

She tilted her head to one side much like a dog and considered the question. "I'm not sure," she admitted.

"When Adonis asked you to strip…"

"Would you like me to take off my clothes, Harry? I'm still very young and so sadly I do not have very large breasts yet, but nonetheless I understand boys like looking at girls. I've grown some pubic hair, if that helps."

"No, I would never ask you to do anything like that," Harry said quickly, blushing all the way down his chest. "I'm just trying to understand you; that's all."

"That will be difficult," Luna said with a hint of a frown. "I'm quite broken, you see. The mind healers could not fix me, and the muggle psychiatrists wished to put me on medication. Father thinks it had something to do with the spell Mum was working on when she died. I was there, you see, and the magical backlash struck me even as it killed my mum. It was a variant of the Cruciatus curse she was trying to adapt for medical purposes."

Harry felt moisture gathering in his eyes. She noticed and smiled weakly. "It's quite all right, Harry. You see, the point of a social anchor is to give me a frame of reference. Nebulous concepts such as right and wrong have no meaning to me. So instead my frame work is, 'What would father do? What would Adonis do?" She reached out and touched Harry's cheek. "And now it is, 'What would Harry or Ginny do?' I find this a much more satisfactory arrangement as we have more common experiences and so I am able to have a more comprehensive frame of reference in which to respond to events."

"But…but…what about dating, Luna? What about finding someone and loving them? Having a family?"

"I have you," she said, "And Ginny. Dating is not something I'm concerned with, and I've been told that love is outside of my emotional understanding. But if it helps, I very much enjoy being around you and Ginny. It is almost like having friends. And if you should ever wish to see me naked, or to touch me, or even to fuck me like an animal…" Here Harry blinked at the casual way she said it. "…I will always do as you ask and enjoy it. The same is true for Ginny. You see, you and Ginny are now my anchors, my frame of reference for how to live my life."</pre>

<pre>"You saw me for me," he whispered into her hair. "Only other girl I know whose done that is Hermione. And probably Luna, although to be honest with you, I don't really know what she sees in me."

Ginny nodded and sighed. She wrapped her arms tighter around the man that she loved. It was time she shared that.

"Harry... I'm in love with you," she said quietly.

Harry blinked and felt something very odd and unfamiliar to him. It was sort of like fear, but more panic-stricken than that, but there was also a greater sense of acceptance, awe, and something more that made him want to tear up and clenched his chest tight. He had nothing to compare it to, so it remained a mystery to him. Besides, there was something much more important that he had to be focusing on too.

"I... I love you too, Ginny," he whispered back to her, his throat tight with emotion.

"But you're not in love with me. Yet," she sighed and snuggled in closer. "That's OK. It's part of being in love, you see," she explained to him. "I've been in love with you since you saved my life, and probably my soul as well, that night in the Chamber of Secrets. I was too young to really see it then, but I see it now. Everything changed for me then. Before, like you said, it was a crush. After that..."

"Yeah, I... I get it," he whispered, not trusting himself to speak.

"No, unfortunately, you don't," she told him, sitting up. "I will do anything for you, Harry. Anything. If you offer me friendship, I'll take that. If you offer me a single date, I'll take that and cherish it always. If you want me to be your girlfriend, I will be the best damn girlfriend you've ever seen or heard about."

She sat up and then repositioned herself on his lap. She pulled open her robe and piece by piece took off the remainder of her clothing. "If you want me to be your lover, I will do my best to love you to the greatest of my ability. If you want me to be your sex toy, I will be content and find joy in every moment. If you want me to be your slave, I will follow you into the pits of Hell and to the gates of Heaven. I will bind myself in chains at your feet and throw away the key with a joyous smile on my face." She was completely naked by this point.

"And," she held his face between both her hands, "if you tell me that you love someone else and that you will never love me, I will respect your wishes and be happy for you. If you tell me that you never want to see me again, I will cry and I will protest, but I will leave and you would never intentionally see me again after that. If you commanded me to kill for you, or to kill myself for you, I would not even hesitate."

She kissed him and the emotion he could not quantify overwhelmed him and it was all he could do to kiss her back, gently holding her to him by the back of her neck and the small of her back.

She ended it with a wet sound and a panting sigh.

"Love means, to me, that you are willing to let the one you love live freely, even if it means hurting yourself. Love can be painful, but it can be so very wonderful. It means that I would be willing to do anything for you and expect absolutely nothing in return, but would cherish with all my soul everything that I did receive from you, my love." She kissed him again, and he was absolutely kissing back.

"So," she huskily said to him after some time snogging, "in answer to your question, the reason why I accept any kind of relationship you offer me, is because I'm in love with you. And I know you're not in love with me. Not yet. Maybe not ever. But as long as I have a chance, I'm not ever going to say no to you, Harry Potter. Not ever."</pre>

<pre>He turned his head to his window and smiled. His Uncle had also granted him a few new improvements to his room to make his incarceration a bit more tolerable (not that his Uncle saw it that way). His window now had the added beauty of shiny metal bars that sparkled when the sun hit them right. Harry spent hours staring at them when they were first installed, using the laser pointer on them when the sunlight just wasn't enough. Locks were also placed on the other side of his door. His Uncle would come up to them and test them out one by one to make sure that they were in proper working order. Harry would rush to the door when he heard his Uncle's heavy footsteps approaching. He loved listening to the odd clicks, clangs, and bangs that the individual locks would make. And best of all, he had a cat flap. A cat flap! His Aunt would use it to slide in food three times a day. It was amazing. No more doing the dishes or slaving away at the stove. It was an automatic food delivery system. It was almost like a vacation. And in his mind, he imagined that it was not his Aunt pushing in the food, but an adorable cat in a tuxedo. Harry even meowed a few times at the flap as his food slipped in. He would always let out a laugh when he heard his Aunt scamper off at the sound.</pre>

<pre>The Mercenary decided drastic time came for drastic measures. He moved to the school bathroom. Deadpool stepped over the bathroom and opened up the stall. He threw the book into the toilet.

A loud scream echoed from the toilet and the book shot out of the toilet. A squat girl with glasses and an angry glare in her eyes burst out of the toilet. She burst into tears.

"I'm so sick and tired of everyone trying to flush Lockhart books down my toilet!" Moaning Myrtle howled at the top of his lungs.</pre>

<pre>The next few rounds were less exciting. He got Padma, but she managed to deflect his suggestive question through a bit of clever wording. True to her word, she only asked the next target, Hermione, something entirely mundane. Then Hermione spun the bottle, and it landed on Harry again.

He accepted another drop, feeling more tranquil and detached than last time. Even the glint in Hermione's eyes didn't alarm him; he discarded it as a fact that was of no concern to him.

"Were you the one to urinate on Crookshanks's bed back in our fourth year?"

"Yes," Harry blurted out. Wincing, he tried to wrestle back control, but it was too late.

Hermione jabbed her finger at him. "I knew it! You did something so horrid, and then you had the gall to lie to my face!"

He rubbed the back of his neck. "Merlin, I can't believe you're still holding a grudge. Crookshanks and I made up ages ago."

"That's not the point!" Her head swiveled around. "Why is no one else shocked by this?"

Su patted her on the shoulder. "Shh, it's okay."

"Give it a rest, Hermione," Padma advised. "This is Harry we're talking about. He just does that kind of thing sometimes."

Hermione lowered her head into her hands and muttered, "You're making it look like I'm the weird one."</pre>

<pre>"After your incredible deed of unearthing Ravenclaw's Diadem, I expected better of you, Harry," Dumbledore said, his very posture exuding disappointment. "When I asked you to retrieve Professor Slughorn's memories, I did not give you license to assault him and dose him with Veritaserum. It is fortunate indeed that you decided to consult me before going through with this reckless scheme."

Slumped in a chair in front of the headmaster's desk, Harry wasn't feeling very repentant. "I've been plotting for days, and this is the only thing I came up with that could work!"

Dumbledore steepled his hands, the right one gloved. "Even ignoring the obvious moral issues, your plan would have never succeeded. Horace is an accomplished Occlumens and could no doubt resist the most powerful of truth serums."

Harry groaned. "Couldn't you have mentioned that earlier? What was I even supposed to do?"

The corners of Dumbledore's quirked upward. "Have you considered talking to him?"

His eyebrows shot up. "I'm not exactly known for my people skills, sir. I don't see a way to make someone that crafty spill his secrets."

"You give yourself too little credit—there is a reason I assigned this task to you specifically, after all." Dumbledore sighed deeply. "But never mind that know. I shall speak with the good professor myself, and impart upon him how vital it is that he share his knowledge with us."

Harry thought that if Dumbledore was capable of persuading Slughorn, he should've done that to begin with, but held his tongue. "What am I supposed to do with all the Veritaserum, then?" he asked instead.

"You have already procured some?" Dumbledore took off his spectacles and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Harry, please tell me you did not steal from Professor Snape."

"I'm no thief!" he exclaimed, half-rising from his chair. "I bought it at Knockturn's black market apothecary like a decent person."

"My sincere apologies. I should have known better than to doubt your integrity," Dumbledore said, sliding his glasses back up his nose.

Harry peered at him suspiciously, but the headmaster looked completely serious. "You're not going to confiscate it or anything?"

Dumbledore waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. "Far be it from me to interfere with a business transaction. Do whatever you please, as long as you promise not to use it on others without their consent."

Harry rubbed his chin. "Not without their consent, huh."</pre>

<pre>"Hogwarts, I've seen the light!" Tony cried behind him. "Please use my worthless life as you see fit!"

The noise ceased as the items in the vicinity stopped moving, and Harry shook his head in disbelief that Tony's words had actually convinced her. He took out his invisibility cloak, applied a Silencer to his shoes, and slunk around as quickly as he dared. He came across an opening between the piles in time to see Tony kneel in front of Hogwarts with a broad grin.

"I accept your sacrifice, mortal," she said imperiously. "Your life force will be the first to fuel—"

Tony's hand darted out and flipped up her skirt. Hogwarts gaped at him, her mouth opening and closing as her cheeks reddened.

"You're supposed to go 'kyaa'," Tony said helpfully.

"Kyaa," she growled, wrapping her slender fingers around the boy's neck. Tony paled and a tremor ran through his body, his limbs thrashing about.</pre>

<pre>Sirius Black slowly calmed down, glad that his godson was now somewhere out of reach from the Ministry of Magic. He knew there were still many supporters of Voldemort that plead to the imperious curse excuse, and they could take revenge on his godson for getting rid of their Lord. His eyes snapped open when he heard a lot of footsteps followed by flashes of light.

He noticed Cornelius was striking a pose in front of an auror carrying a camera, with his wand pointed forward. Sirius couldn't help it... he tried to control himself, but seeing Fudge's large potbelly and trying to look brave, the marauder in him couldn't resist.

"Ahhhh! Dementors!" Sirius shouted.

The effect of his shout was instantaneous. Fudge suddenly leaped backward and tried to let out a curse from his wand, but it flew from his grip and clattered to the ground. Fudge's aides dived behind the aurors who had their wands out and searching for the dementor attack.

The aurors stationed in Azkaban merely looked around. They knew there was no Dementor on the maximum security wing, and experience taught them that you'd feel a dementor's presence before you saw one. Silence ensued for a moment before they heard a deep, barking laugh from one of the cells.

"Where's the Dementor?"

Everyone in the vicinity heard Fudge's voice, and the aurors, seeing that there was no threat, moved apart, revealing a Minister of Magic huddled on the ground, shaking with fear.

"False alarm, minister." One of the aurors said. His face remained impassive, though his eyes were twinkling with amusement. He couldn't wait to tell Moody about this.

"Oh." Fudge slowly got up, while his aides picked up fallen documents that they had dropped around the vicinity.

Sirius saw a roll of newspaper and used the opportunity to snatch it through the bars while everyone were still trying to organize themselves and determine what happened.

"WHO DID IT?"

"I think it was shouted by one of the prisoners, minister." The lead auror suggested.

"Yes, yes, probably trying to cause panic!" Fudge appeared to have regained his composure, his face red and his clothes dirtied from diving into the ground. He was breathing heavily and looked at the faces of his retinue, they all looked away when he tried to meet their eyes, and he knew the reason why.

"You!" Fudge snarled at the auror holding a camera. "You got the pictures?"

"Yes minister Fudge!"

"I'll be cutting this inspection short." Fudge said to the lead auror. "Find out who caused this... distraction and punish them appropriately."

"Begging your pardon minister." The auror began. "But most of the prisoners on this wing are mad from over exposure to the dementors. It's normal for us to hear them scream every now and then.

"Oh." Fudge didn't know what to do, and looked to his aides for help. One whispered into his ear and a after a few seconds the minister of magic straightened up and glanced at his auror guard.

"It looks like I have pressing matters of the ICW waiting for me." Fudge declared. "Let's go back to the docks."

Fudge and his party quickly moved away from the maximum security wing, while a few of the Azkaban guards lingered for a moment.

"Good one Black." The lead auror said.

"Thanks."</pre>

<pre>Hermione absently gave the bird the payment as she removed the roll of paper from the Owl's leg, her concentration on her breakfast. Suddenly the noise in the great hall grew louder as students started reacting from reading the front page of the daily prophet.

Hermione was about to take a bite of sausage when she dropped her fork and it clattered on the table.

"Hermione?" Padma looked at her friend with worry. She followed her roommate's gaze and her eyes widened in shock.

"Harry! You're... you're betrothed!?" Padma exclaimed. Other students started looking at the Boy-Who-Lived and even some pointed at him.

Harry had been expecting the news of his betrothal to turn public and nodded, though he was a bit surprised at the reaction of the students.

"What is the meaning of this?" Hermione hissed.

"It's a common practice for traditional Pureblood families Hermione..." Padma said after she finally regained her composure. "These Families use the betrothal contracts to form alliances with other families."

"This is barbaric!" Hermione fumed. "Can anything be done about this?"

"You can't get away from a betrothal, Hermione... It's a magical binding contract." Padma said. She looked at Harry and gave him a sad smile. "I never thought that the Potters followed the old ways."

Hermione speared her sausage and chewed her food furiously, obviously in a bad mood. "The wizarding world is horrible... the society is so backwards!"

Padma did not choose to reply, she knew that Hermione was in a bad mood. It only got worse when Michael Corner sat down to join them.

"Hey Harry..." Michael sat down beside his roommate. "Why didn't you tell me you were betrothed to an older French girl? Good job by the way!"

"Good Job?" Hermione asked. "Harry's being forced to marry a girl he barely knows!"

"So?" Michael shrugged. "He's getting betrothed to one of the Delacour daughters. They're rich, and rumors say they're Veela. I say Harry's lucky."

"Veela?" Hermione gasped. "Oh Harry! Be careful! Veela are known to use their charms to entrance males! They cannot be trusted!"

Harry frowned at this. Fleur was not bad, and he never even experienced an ounce of charm from Fleur or her mother. "When I stayed with the Delacours last summer, I never experienced the Veela charm from Fleur and Apolline."

"Fleur?" Hermione narrowed her eyes.

"That's her name." Harry said. "She's quite nice, she even plays with me."

"She plays with you?" Michael leaned forward, eager to hear more.

Harry nodded. "Sometimes we play for hours on the bed... it's the best spot."

"On the... bed?" Hermione said weakly.

"Yep." Harry said. "But Fleur usually quits after an hour or so... I think I tire her out. Anyway, I have to go, business calls."

Hermione, Padma and Michael looked on as Harry headed out of the great hall, not at the least perturbed as hundreds of students looked at him.</pre>

<pre>"Now Harry, can you do a howl of a werewolf?" Gilderoy asked.

"No." Harry said immediately while he looked at the man wondering what he was up to. He had not forgotten that incident at Diagon Alley where the flamboyant man had eaten his sandwich without permission.

"It's simple..." Gilderoy smiled. "Can you do... Awwwooooo?"

"Awoooo?" Harry asked and he shot a look at his fellow male students who were sniggering in their seats.

"Yes that!" Gilderoy encouraged his fellow celebrity. "Now raise your hands in front of you and do it again."

Harry muttered under his breath and raised his hands. "Awu..."

Gilderoy clapped his hands in delight. "Yes that's it!" He turned to the rest of the class and continued his fearsome tale. "Now, the savage werewolf had just swiped my wand in front of me... and I stood my ground and faced him... while a cold wind blew in my face as the full moon gave the surrounding forest an ethereal glow."

He turned to his fellow celebrity and grinned. "Now try to attack me Harry, and attempt to subdue me... without using magic."

"Huh?" Harry asked dumbly.

"Attack me... lunge towards me." Gilderoy encouraged his student as he struck a heroic pose, placing his hands on his hips and puffing out his chest. "Try to incapacitate me."

"Okay..." Harry said. He eyed the celebrity professor in front of him and in a flash he kicked the man's shin... hard.

"Gahhh!" Gilderoy jumped up and down as pain seared up his leg while half the class burst into laughter. The Defense Professor started hopping on one foot while he massaged his bruised leg with his hand.

"Are you ok professor?" Harry asked, trying not to smile.

"I'm fine Harry... good kick." Gilderoy's eyes watered as he gave a tight smile. After massaging the pain away from his leg he stood up. "An unusual attack... I was giving you a chance. Try again Harry."

Gilderoy stood in a stance, ready for the young boy's attack.

"Again?" Harry asked as he grinned at the Defense Professor.

"Again." Gilderoy said. He faced the rest of the class and smiled again. "The Werewolf is known for its strength, and the one I wrestled with had arms as thick as my body. Go ahead Harry."

"Awuuu!!!" Harry raised his in the air and prepared to attack, raising his leg halfway up his body.

"I've seen that stance somewhere...." Hermione whispered to Padma. "In a movie... but I can't recall the title. We watched it this summer with Harry..."

"That's the spirit!" Gilderoy said happily. He prepared an attack on his feet again and he tensed his arms, ready to deflect the boy's left kick and wrestle him to ground using his superior strength and weight.

Harry jumped again and instead of using his left leg, he kicked with his right while in the air. His foot landed squarely on Gilderoy's groin, sending the five time winner of Witch Weekly's most charming smile award to the ground moaning in pain.

"Now I remember... the Karate Kid!" Hermione declared.</pre>

<pre>"Oh Jules..." Apolline Delacour giggled as her husband tossed her to the bed. She struck an artful and seductive pose, while Julian hurried to remove his coat and jacket.

Their date had gone very well, and the wine had helped loosen their inhibitions. Tonight was a night for passion, a night of love making and nothing else. The warm wind blew from the open balcony of their Marseilles beach house, caressing their bodies and enhancing the ambiance of the room.

Apolline smiled at her husband while the full moon bathed her skin, making her glow like a goddess from the heavens. If there was such a night for passion and sex, this was it.

Julian Delacour gave a predatory smile to his wife as he crawled towards the bed while Apolline giggled as her wrists were suddenly tied by silky scarves to the posts of the bed. The Delacour couple loved role playing, since it only heightened the pleasure they both felt.

"Oh Merlin... I didn't know they were kinky. Good job son!"

"I have to give it to your son... that's one fine catch."

"I never thought my baby boy would grow up to be like this... I remember when I first vanished his first poo poo."

The Delacour couple froze and stared wide eyed at each other. Julian climbed off his wife and scrambled to wrap his waist with the blanket while he looked around for the source of the noise.

"Ohhh Mama!"

"Nice Rack..."

"Julian!" Apolline screamed as the other portraits leered at her. "Untie me!"

Julian nodded and vanished the scarves and his wife used the large pillows to hide her assets. Apolline peered looked around the walls looking for the source of the voices.

"Honey, when did we have the portraits of your ancestors hung in your bedroom?" Apolline asked, recognizing the pictures of the old men winking at her. She glared back at the portraits and grabbed another pillow to hide her creamy white thighs from view.

"And where are the muggle paintings I bought?" Apolline added, looking around the walls. She had chosen to decorate this room with muggle scenic paintings to ensure privacy in the bedroom whenever she and Julian played their 'games'.

Julian peered through the gloom and stepped closer to the painting of his deceased mother. He knew he had a smaller painting of her in the private library in Paris and not of this size.

"Mother?" Julian asked."Where did you come from?"

"Jules!" Francesca Delacour greeted her son, though she wore a small grin in her face. "I'm from our ancestor's collection, Perenelle Flamel. Harry asked me if I wanted to see a nice view of the beach and of course I agreed..."

"That Thief..." Julian gritted his teeth with frustration. He looked around and wondered what else was missing or misplaced in their beach house. He looked at his wife who was still trying to hide her modesty from his forefathers' lecherous gazes and sighed in defeat. He hated playing Harry's game.</pre>

<pre>"So that's the sorting hat..." Hermione whispered as the ancient artifact finished its song. "It looks old."

"I forgot that your batch was not sorted traditionally, and it's the first time for all of you to see it." Cho Chang, a third year Ravenclaw commented. She halfway stood up from her seat and observed the sorting hat closer. "It looks different."

"It is?" Hermione asked.

"Yeah... I can't see much closer... but it looks like it has a lighter shade... I remember from my sorting that it was pure black." Cho Chang replied. Similar conversations took place around the great hall, wondering what happened to the recently recovered sorting hat.

"Abercomb, Paul!" Minerva read from her scroll and a young boy shyly stepped forward and headed for the hat.

The young boy sat on the hat and the Deputy Headmistress, determined to make sure that the artifact was not to be stolen again, placed it on top of the first year's head. Unlike the previous sorting where the hat just lay on a student's head, it now encompassed the whole head inside its body.

"Ahckk! It smells!" The young boy's voice muffled voice was heard, causing most of the students to laugh.

"What do you expect." Franz the Sorting Hat grumbled. "Try having gallons of mucus poured down your throat and let's see if you still smell like daisies. Now shut up and let me sort you."

Paul Abercomb just remained quiet, holding his breath and hoping the hat decide quickly. Finally after half a minute it shouted "Hufflepuff!"

McGonagall removed the hat and the young boy fell on his knees gasping for breath. "That was horrible." The young boy said.

"So is your hair." The hat snapped back. "Wash your hair properly, you have dandruff."

"Perhaps I can help you with that... here Mister Abercomb." Gilderoy Lockhart tossed a small bottle and the first year caught it.

"It's a free sample of my hair care product. That should take care of your Dandruff problem, and give your hair the smooth sheen like mine" The Defense Professor combed his hair with hand for effect, and it glinted at the torch light, drawing a certain thief's attention to it.

The young boy nodded as he pocketed the bottle, while the new Defense Professor gave a charming smile causing most of the female population to smile.

"Merlin help us." Severus Snape muttered. Inwardly, he contemplated asking the Defense Professor for a sample to analyze it, but he would never admit that to anyone, even to the Dark Lord.

The next students to be sorted had the same reactions, until the first girl to be sorted was called out.

"Brown, Adelle!"

The blonde haired girl wearing pigtails cautiously sat down and McGonagall immediately placed the hat over her head. Like the others the hat slid down, the lips of the hat touching her shoulders. Immediately the girl lifted the hat out of her head.

"What is the matter dear?" McGonagall asked.

"It's smelly!" The girl declared.

"You just have to endure it Miss Brown." McGonagall said as he lips thinned.

The young girl decided that she will do something about the smell and pulled out a small bottle of perfume.

Squirt

Squirt

"Ahck! What in Merlin's name? Stop it girl!" The hat shouted as the girl continued spraying a generous amount of perfume on the inside of the hat.

She took a sniff of the inside of the hat and finally decided it was doing its job masking the previous smell. She placed the hat back down on her head and sighed as she smelled her own perfume.

"You little bitch..." The sorting hat said.

"Franz!" The Headmaster warned amidst the muffled laughter inside the hall. It was the longest sorting by far, but the students were not complaining about it since they were enjoying the spectacle, even the Slytherins.

The next few Girls to be sorted thought that Adelle Brown's actions were brilliant and they too started to spray or dab the insides of the hat with their own perfumes. It was fine for the girls, but the boys to be sorted found the concentrated smell of perfume to be far worse and they held their breath for the duration of the sorting.

"Creevey, Colin!"

A small first year boy, walked eagerly to the stool, eager to wear the magical hat.

"Hmm yes... very difficult..." The hat said as it looked into the young boy's memories.

"Could you please hurry it up mister hat?" Colin asked loudly. "I'm getting dizzy from the smell of perfume."

"We must not rush this Mister Creevey..." The Hat said. "Ahh yes... very brave... and very loyal. Difficcult... quite difficult."

"I'm getting dizzy." Colin said weakly as he swayed on his seat.

"Just a few more minutes." The hat replied.

"I think I'm going to be sick." The young first year said.

"Sick... oh HELL! Minerva! Remove me from the boy's head!" The hat screamed. "Quickly!"

"Are you sure?" Minerva hesitated. "You haven't shouted his house yet Franz."

The Deputy Headmistress' hesitation made it too late as Colin Creevey started puking as he tried to remove the hat that had a snug fit over his head.

"Aw Shit!" The Hat swore. "That's it! I quit! I can't take more of this abuse!"

The hat continued to squirm as it was held by a disgusted Minerva McGonagall by the tip. "I shouldn't have returned! Steal me again! To anyone who is listening!"

The students watched in fascination as vomit poured down the neck of the young boy who was struggling and finally Minerva removed the hat from the boy's head.

Bleerghhh!

Colin vomited one last time, in front of the assembled students of the four houses.

"Ewwwww." The assembled students from the four houses said in unison, while the yet to be sorted first years watched in horror and fear knowing they had to wear the hat.</pre>

<pre>"Harry... Harry! Wake up Harry!" Hermione increased the volume of her voice but the boy who lived didn't stir.

"Why don't we try and tickle him?" Padma suggested as she approached the bed.

"Let's tickle the leg then." Hermione said and the two girls began to tickle the boy who lived with their fingers.

SMACK!

"AWwwwww" Hermione grabbed her face as Padma immediately covered her eye with her left hand. The boy's leg tensed as it felt the unfamiliar sensation and immediately kicked out, hitting Hermione's face while his knee slammed into Padma Patil.

"My eye..." Padma moaned.

"My nose..." Hermione added as her eyes moistened with pain. "It hurts..."

Harry finally woke up and he scrubbed his eyes and was puzzled at the sight of his two classmates on their knees beside his bed.

"What are you two doing down there?" Harry asked. He noticed Hermione was holding her hands to her nose and mouth while Padma covered her left eye with her hands. "Hermione, your nose is bleeding."

"I'd knowb!" Hermione shouted angrily through her hanky.</pre>

<pre>In the middle of her breakfast, Hermione watched with amusement as Ginny and Luna emerged from their sand fort, both looking sleepy and rumpled.

"Did you two stay in there all night?" she asked as Ginny reached for the coffee and Luna grabbed the nearest sugary pastry.

"Well, it seemed such a waste to furnish it so nicely and not make use of it," Luna said.

"Furnish it?"

Ginny shrugged. "Well, we had a pile of blankets and a vaguely bench shaped section of sand." She looked over to the fort, which from the outside looked far more elaborate and impressive. "Maybe we could have tried a little harder in there."

"It was comfy enough."

"True." Ginny took another sip of her coffee, and promptly choked on it. "Oh dear Merlin my eyes!"

"Oh, Harry is making use of the Headmaster's birthday gift," Luna said.

Hermione looked. She immediately regretted it. Harry was wearing electric blue robes, covered in bright, glittery pineapples and bananas. He was also walking their way.

"Good morning!" he said cheerfully.

"Harry," Hermione said, horrified but unable to look away. "Harry, why are you wearing those?"

"These?" He looked down at his robes as though he'd forgotten, somehow, that he was so brightly attired. "They seemed appropriate for the beach theme. And look, the Headmaster is clearly delighted that I'm making use of his gift."

"Why couldn't you have just kept them for traumatising Death Eaters?" Ginny lamented.

"Because traumatising my friends is more fun?" He grinned at Ginny's disgusted eye-roll. "Well, if they're upsetting you so much I'll take them off."

"Only if you're wearing something under them," Hermione said promptly. "There are children in here."

"I am hurt and offended that you think I would consider stripping down completely in front of firsties and Professor McGonagall, Hermione."

She just sighed, and Harry shrugged out of his robes, dropping them on the nearest bench.

"Ugh," Ginny said, eyeing Harry's swimming shorts. "Really?"

Harry's shorts were bright orange, which wasn't so bad, but they were covered in animated snakes wearing hula skirts and dancing. "What, you don't like them?"

"I think they're cheerful and charming," Pansy said as she stepped up behind him. "Although, a little hypnotic."

"Please, go swimming," Ginny said. "The fish will try and eat your pants. And hopefully so will Hedwig."

"Hedwig is too smart to be fooled by a pair of shorts," Harry said, offended.

"Not if she's drunk," Ginny muttered.

"Are you calling my owl an owl-coholic?"

"I think you're the one who called her that first."

Pansy glanced at Hermione. "Should I worry on behalf of Hedwig, here?"

Hermione shrugged helplessly. "I honestly don't know. Either she has a genuine addiction, or, and I admit this is what I suspect to be true, she's found her inner actress over the summer."

Hedwig, with a perfect sense of dramatic timing, hooted and swooped down over the table, grabbing a talon full of bacon and landing on Hermione's shoulder to eat it.

"You see?" Hermione said.

Pansy just nodded, reaching out and stroking Hedwig's feathers. "Far too smart an owl to have turned to the bottle," she said, almost cooing. Hedwig hooted approvingly and fluttered over to Pansy's shoulder instead.</pre>

<pre>"Albus, there must be something that we can do," Minerva pleaded, turning her attention to him. "The boy skips every class except for Charms and Defense, he only really talks to Alastor...you know I respect the man, but even you can't deny that he has had a negative influence on Harry this year...I just don't know what to do!"

"I'm sitting right bloody here, Minerva," Alastor snorted derisively. "But anyway, I would advise not calling him a disgrace to his parents' sacrifice. Oh, wait...I suppose that's half the reason we're in here to begin with!"

Minerva's face paled, and Albus's head spun toward her, his face a mask of cold fury. "You...you actually said that to a student? To a child?!"

"I'm sor—"

"Apologizing to me will solve nothing, Minerva," Albus snapped furiously, barely containing his anger at the uncharacteristically narrow-minded, short-sighted stupidity of his deputy. "The problem is not that Harry Potter is skipping classes. The problem is that we have allowed this school to become a such a hostile environment to the boy that sooner or later, he will rise to everyone's expectations and become the Dark Lord that they are practically begging him to be! And unlike Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter will actually have plenty of excellent reasons to destroy our community!"</pre>

<pre>Why was it so quiet?

Looking up, Harry checked the illusion of his 'version 3' body. Fairly tall, tight muscles, night black hair, near-glowing green eyes, dark blue scar on his forehead... and clothed this time. Looking around he realized the girls were... overly distracted. Was that drool?

Neville looked normal at least, if not a bit confused why the girls were all slack-jawed. Where was Terry anyway? Oh, watching Quidditch practices, thank you Watcher.

Giving a light cough, Harry grinned. "Well? Any changes I should make?"

Tracey had a vicious grin. "Maybe some male enhancement?"

He shook his head. "Wisdom already had to reduce my size a bit, said something about safety."

Harry blinked as several girls blushed VERY badly. Why were they embarrassed about how tall he was?</pre>

<pre>"Megan Jones, reporting for duty," the Hufflepuff girl said with a playful salute. She had short blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and was chewing bubblegum.

Harry grinned. "Nice to have you on the team. Just to get it out of the way, how're you doing in Defense? I already know Hermione's grades."

"Who doesn't," Megan said with a roll of her eyes, before shooting a wary glance at the witch in question. "Anyways, I got an A on my OWL. Wouldn't have continued with the class, but my folks insisted."

Hermione placed her hands on her hips. "What about the breakdown between the theory and the practical?"

"E for the theory..." Megan fidgeted with a Hippogriff-shaped pin her robes. "And a P for spellwork, but I swear, that examiner had it in for me!"

Harry suppressed a groan. He should've known something was up when Snape actually agreed to put him on a team with two girls. There was nothing else to do but make the best of the situation.

"Not to worry, we'll just have to get some practice in," he said. "Hermione can hold her own, and with me leading, we should have a fighting chance."

"When did we decide on you being the leader?" Hermione asked with a frown. "That should obviously be me."

Harry could hardly believe what he was hearing. "Don't take it the wrong way, but I'm better than you."

She bristled. "You might be slightly better at spellcasting, but this calls for careful strategizing. You'd just try do something needlessly showy."

He shrugged. "What's the point of magic if it isn't flashy?"

"That's precisely the problem! You're not being sensible."

He leveled his gaze on her. "Hermione, we have to be unpredictable to win. If you just go by the book—"

"Hey, maybe I could be leader," Megan piped up. She shrunk back when both Harry and Hermione glared at her. "Never mind, just a thought. I'm going to catch up with my friends while you two geniuses figure it out."</pre>

<pre>He found himself in a room painted in pastel lavender and furnished with bookshelves, a writing desk, and a single bed. There was a curtained window on the far wall—another first for the Room of Requirement—and several doors on the sides, identical to the one he just opened. As the thought that this looked like a girl's bedroom occurred to him, he suddenly became aware of the person standing in the middle.

He lurched backwards before steadying himself and regarding the slim figure. It was a teenage witch with sleek black hair that fell almost to her waist. She looked as surprised as he was, her peculiarly violet eyes wide as they roved over the room. Her baggy uniform robes lacked any house colors, but she looked too old to be a first-year. Was she the fabled transfer student?

"Are you lost? The Sorting takes place on the ground floor," Harry said hesitantly. Realizing that he was still holding the half-empty bottle, he hid it behind his back and into his malletspace.

"Do I look like a schoolgirl to you?" she asked, her dulcet voice contrasting with her sharp tone. She glanced down at herself and did a double-take. "Founders forfend, I do."

He stuck his hand into his pocket and materialized his wand. "Who are you?"

The girl furrowed her brows. "I am... I am Hogwarts."

Harry debated bringing out his drink again, then considered the possibility that Firewhisky was responsible for the whole thing in the first place. It was a testament to the amount of weirdness he had seen over the years that he didn't immediately dismiss her claim.

"Seriously? For an ancient castle, you look kinda..." He gestured vaguely with his hand.

"I look the way you envisioned me," she said with a note of accusation. "You are the one who made this happen."

He raised his eyebrows. "All I did was ask for help."

"What exactly where you thinking when you opened the door?" she pressed, her eyes narrowing in a look that might've been threatening on someone a foot taller.

Harry rubbed his forehead, willing his alcohol-addled brain to work. "I don't know. It was all jumbled in my head."

She threw her hands up, making her overly-long sleeves flap. "Great, I was manifested by a cretin. Did it never occur to you that I was perfectly content with my existence as the pinnacle of magical architecture, and not having to lug this—this feeble flesh-puppet around?"

"It's not like I did it on purpose," he protested. "I have no clue what happened!"

"You want to know what happened?" The girl walked up and jabbed a finger at his chest. "I'll tell you what happened! It must be difficult for a puny human like you, but think a couple of millennia back, when I was built by a quartet of individuals infinitely smarter than yourself. So there I was, a marvel of engineering, soaking up the students' magic and slowly gaining in power, yet never crossing the line into sentience. I had no emotions nor desires—it was a dream, a slumber, it was... peace."

She looked so tranquil that Harry held his breath, afraid of ruining the moment, but her face was soon marred by a scowl. "Then some idiot brought the Philosopher's Stone here, and another idiot blew it up in the middle of an embodiment ritual. As always, my walls absorbed the excess energies, and suddenly I was more—not fully conscious, but almost. All it would take was a tiny push."

"Which I just provided," Harry murmured, reeling from the revelation.

She glared at him. "Not only that, it was your twisted, intoxicated mind which shaped my body!"

He tilted his head in confusion. "Er, you're not particularly ugly or anything."

She snorted. "You'd say that, of course."

"Do you really remember everything?" he asked before she could find something else to blame him for. "All the way back to the Founders?"

She was quiet for a time, a faraway look coming over her eyes. "My early recollections are vague, but they're there. Everyone who passed through my halls left their imprints on me, but until today, I never truly perceived them. That's why this new experience is so unsettling. When I recall a memory now, I feel things. Pride in my graduates, the sorrow of loss, the joy of festivity..."

She shivered. "It's scary, how intensely my body is reacting—it's like it is in control of me rather than the other way around. Especially when I think about... even at this moment, there are lovers in the castle..." She closed her eyes and hugged herself, biting her lip. "Ah, wow. I can see why humans do this..."

Harry gulped, ogling her squirming form. This was his chance to explore Hogwarts's other Chamber of Secrets. A part of him screamed that he would be taking advantage of her, but... she was technically thousands of years old, right?

He cleared his throat. "Sh-should I take responsibility?"

Her eyes flew open, and her dainty hand which had been gliding down her stomach froze an inch above the waistband of her skirt. "What?" she asked in a dazed voice.

"I could help you scratch that itch," he said, waggling his eyebrows.

Her gaze focused on Harry, then on herself. She squeaked and flung her hands away from their almost-compromising positions, her cheeks turning pink. "Y-you, you dare—a mere human—"

"Is that a no?" he asked.

Her blush deepened and her hair came alive, defying gravity as it framed her slight figure like a halo of black. In an instant, Harry was reminded that she was not entirely human.

"Get out," she growled, not meeting his eyes.

"It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Such urges are perfectly normal for a girl your age—"

"Get out!" she shrieked, swinging her arms like a windmill.

A pillow zoomed through the air and smacked him in the face, his smarting nose catching a whiff of something floral. The books rattled in their shelves before swooping at him, and a bulky tome punched him in the stomach, knocking out his wind. Then the bed itself shook and rose off the floor, and Harry got the hint, turning tail and scurrying outside.

Slamming the door shut, he heard something impact it on the other side, before it faded into an unassuming stone wall.

"Shaped by my mind, my ass," he muttered, lowering himself to the floor. "No way I thought up someone that violent."

Harry stayed that way for a while, retrieving the Firewhisky and having a sip when it got too cold. When his eyes grew heavy and he started yawning, he figured he'd given her enough time to cool down.

He stood up and paced, repeating 'I need help' in his head, but the wall remained unchanged. Frowning, he tried a couple of different requests, but the Room didn't respond to anything.

"Hogwarts, come on, let's talk about this!" he yelled, banging on the wall with his fist. "I still need your help, damn it!"

No reply forthcoming, he slumped on the floor and curled himself into a ball. He was going to have a short rest before heading to the tower.

Harry woke to his shoulder being shaken. He opened his eyes a crack, winced at the glare, and squeezed them shut again. The shaking didn't cease.

"Feck off," he mumbled.

"We need to speak, Harry," Dumbledore said, "and Madam Pomfrey has prepared a potion that will make you feel better."

His eyes shot open, watering from the sunlight flooding the hospital wing, and he stammered an apology, but the headmaster merely held up a gloved palm and handed him a steaming vial. Harry downed it in one go and sighed blissfully as his headache abated.

"You will be glad to know that I was the one who discovered you and brought you here," Dumbledore said. "Madam Pomfrey has been told there were extenuating circumstances. As such, you will not be punished."

Harry slumped back against his pillow in relief, but then Dumbledore clasped his hands and continued, "That being said, I expected better of you, Harry. Drowning your sorrows in drink will not get you anywhere. I want you to promise not to do such a thing again."

"Yes, sir," he said, unable to meet the headmaster's eyes.

Dumbledore patted his shoulder. "As I told you before, you are not alone. The Order, the Hogwarts staff, your friends and family—everyone will aid you in your task."

Harry's eyebrows knitted together as he recalled yesterday's events. It all seemed like a dream now. "Sir, has Hogwarts ever, well"—he licked his cracked lips—"spoken to you?"

Dumbledore peered first at Harry, then at the empty bottle of Firewhisky on the bedside table. "Madam Pomfrey," he called out, "I believe we need a Detoxifying Solution."</pre>

<pre>"So...many...cup sizes..." Harry gasped as he staggered into an empty train compartment. It would seem the article spoke true, he lost count of the times a girl had succumbed to the desire to snuggle him. Not he truly minded, mind you, but the fact most of the girls were somewhat older, and several times he was embraced face-first, and level with a certain part of their body..two items to be specific.

"I'll say. Girls around here are definatly cat lovers."

By the time he managed to get away, his hair was even messier than normal and his face redder than a tomato.

After a few minutes he was able to settle down and let himself go limp as he got his trunk put up and the . Before he could nod off, the door opened and a familiar face came in.

"Hey, Hermione." He said, freezing when he saw the look on her face, "What..?"

"You pummeled Gilderoy Lockheart! Our new DA teacher!" She yelled, flailing her arms madly.

"He almost fondled me!" He said in his defense, "Besides, I've read his books, and to be honest, I find them to be complete and utter bovine fecal matter."

The bushy-haired Gryffindor's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets at this statement, "H-Harry! How can you say that!? Look at everything he's done!"

"Everything he CLAIMS he's done, Hermione. I read that 'Year with the Yeti'one...there are entire chapters dedicated soley to him primping and offering fashion and haircare tips. As for what he says to have done.." Harry popped his trunk open and took out the book. Flipping through pages, he came on the chapter he wanted, "Here we go, according to this, he claims he faced off against the leader of a yeti tribe and trounced it with his bare hands. Tell me, Hermione, you know how big a yeti can get?"

"Well," She crossed her eyes as she recalled one of the books she had read, "Most range from eight to nine feet tall and can weigh up to half a ton. Though some have been known to reach twelve feet and a full ton or more."

"All right. And Lockheart's what, five-nine? Five-ten? And looks to be about a hundred eighty at most, soaking wet? Add the fact that the majority of wizards don't really to exercise their bodies. Merlin, girl, Hagrid could rip his spine out and floss with it without even trying; do you honestly think that man could take on something that can be even bigger than our groundskeeper?"

The compartment was dead silent as she processed the information Harry just dropped on her.

"But..but...all the things in his books.." She said weakly.

+

McGonagall gradually went down the list until she came to the name that made Harry try to hide behind Hermione.

"Weasley, Ginny!"

George shook his head, "Maybe it won't be too bad, Harry. You'll be in different classes at least"

"Yeah, but what about the rest of the time?? Hedwig had to act as my bodyguard just so I could take a bloody nap!" He mewed pitifully as the girl shamelessly made a kissing motion to him as she went to the hat.

"Well, another Weasley..let's see.." The hat muttered, "Oh my...oh my! Good heavens! OH DEAR MERLIN, get me off this girl!" The hat shrieked as it literally jumped off her head, "I cannot, on the grounds of morel and ethical standards, subject that poor guy to this! Therefore, SLYTHERIN!"

The hall went dead quiet at the hat's proclaimation before suddenly breaking into hushed whispers...a Weasley in THAT house?

Fred and George gulped, "Mum's not gonna like this...."

Dumbledore sputtered, using his Legilimancy to contact the hat, "Are you daft!? Resort her to Gryffindor! I need her with Harry to bring him back to the Light!"

"Then YOU'RE the daft one, Headmaster!" Came the retort, "The majority of students in Slytherin are already demented, she'll fit in perfectly!"

"I insist you resort her! She is part of a Light-sided family, she MUST be in Gryffindor!"

"And I'm telling you, NO WAY! You haven't seeing what's in this girl's mind! Harry's not perfect, but he doesn't deserve that!"

Ginny, on the other hand, was livid, "WHAT!? How DARE you not put me with my Harry!? Resort me! NOW!" She hissed, trying to put the hat bck on her head.

"No way! Not Happening!" It yelled, bounding behind McGonagall, "Your head's scary!"

"My mother'll hear about this!" She screamed as McGonagall managed to usher her over to her new table, "I'll get you for this, you miserable piece of headgear!"

Draco sneered as she sat down, "Great..a blood trai.." He was cut off when Ginny wheeled around on him and snarled, making the blonde let out a very feminine shriek as he tried to put Pansy between him and her.

"Couldn't happen to a nicer guy." Harry said as the Transfiguration teacher managed to compose herself and finish reading the list.</pre>

<pre>"Oh, by the way..." his voice took on a casual, conversational tone as he turned his eyes towards the front of the class, "I want my book back."

The soft blush on her face instantly exploded into a full crimson as she shuffled nervously in her chair. Her first attempts at words, came out as nothing more than a mousy squeak, before she managed to stutter out, "Wh-what... b-b-book Nar-naruto-kun?"

"Hinata-chan..." the words were soft but stern as he held his hand up to her expectantly.

Still caught in a hot, full body blush, the girl rummaged around in her over-sized coated then reluctantly handed over a small blue book. The look on her face went beyond sheepish as she gave him a small, hesitant little smile, "S-s-sorry..."

"Its all right Hinata-chan," he smiled back at her now as he brought the book over to him, "Just ASK next time, that book was supposed to go to the old man," he paused a moment, before grinning as he leaned in, whispering lightly into her ear, "Do I need to be worried about you reading this with sticky fingers Hinata-chan?"

The girl seemed to grow even redder if it was possible, shrinking down into her jacket, as if trying to make herself completely invisible as she refused to look him in the eyes. When she didn't say anything he sighed softly and shook his head as he lightly reached behind her and rubbed her back, "Calm down Hinata-chan, I'm just teasing you," he paused a moment before grinning softly, "Though, hmmm... I wonder, how much an autographed, Hyuuga flavored book would sell for..."

The girl couldn't help but let out a soft, strangled whimper as she finally looked at him, pleadingly over the top of her jacket, her wide eyes almost filled with tears as they stared pleadingly at him. Her breaths came heavy and labored, as he watched her, before gently he kept stroking her back, "Easy Hinata-chan, easy..." He sighed, just a bit before looking down into her eyes, "One of these days we're gonna get you over all that."

Gently he reached up and began to stroke her hair soothingly as he waited for her to calm down while he carefully used his other hand to put his book away. After a few moments, when her labored breaths finally slowed down he looked at her again, "Better?"

She nodded quickly, blushing still before she managed a stuttering, "S-sorry N-naruto-kun."

"You're getting better," he offered her a grin as he would keep stroking her hair until she fully extracted herself from her jacket, when his fingers pulled away earning a slight, yearning whimper from the girl as she looked at him like a begging puppy, "I swear Hinata-chan, you're worse than Akamaru about getting petted."

The girl's only response with a pleading little whimper, as those puppy dog eyes returned in full force as she looked pleadingly at him. With a resigned sigh, he reached up and once more began to stroke his fingers through her hair, earning a contented sigh as she leaned over against him, "Thank you Naruto-kun."

"Yeah yeah, you're just trying to ruin my hard earned reputation," He grinned softly as he would lightly caressed his finger a finger just behind her ear, "Though, I will admit, you do make quite the cute pet..."

The blush instantly returned in full forced, though, she giggled softly, a small trickle of blood running down from underneath her nose, veins throbbing around her eyes. Coughing softly into his free hand, he spoke, "If you don't stop staring under my pants Hinata-chan, I'm gonna stop."

"Hehehehe," the girl giggled softly, her eyes distant and only half focused as she lightly licked her drying lips as she would grin in response, getting an eyeful before she would finally deactivate her eyes, "Mmmmm..."

"You're such a pervert Hinata-chan," the blonde boy sighed softly as he looked at her before casually continuing to stroke through her hair as she reddened.

"A-a-and what does that m-make you then Naruto-kun?" she reddened for a moment before grinning shyly back at him.

"Damned good," he winked and laughed as she blushed again, then nodded quietly as they simply sat there, waiting for class to start, or at least trying to.

"Will you two knock it off?" there was an angry growl rumbling past the lips of a pink haired Sakura Haruno as she whipped her head around and glared at the two, "Go be perverted somewhere else!"

"Sorry Haruno," Naruto smirked softly, "No can do, we're here to graduate."

"Ha! You mean like the last two times you tried, dead last?" she glared at him, "Like you could pass!"

Seeing the look of irritation that grew on Hinata's face as she stiffened beneath his fingers, the boy decided to simply nip the problem in the bud, "Don't mind Haruno, Hinata-chan," He grinned as he spoke to her in a stage whisper, "She's still pissed that her precious Sasuke-kun is more interested in what's in my pants than wants in hers."

There was an unintelligible shriek of rage that erupted past the girl's lips as Sakura almost threw herself at the boy in an attempt to beat his skull into a bloody paste. She got as far as getting to her feet before a voice shouted out back at her, "SAKURA! Sit down and calm down! No fighting in class outside of designated combat!"

"But Iruka-sensei!" the girl began, "He started it!"

"Sakura," Iruka just gave her a look, "He was talking to Hinata, at no point in time did he address you or say anything to you until after you spoke to him. If you can't control yourself enough to keep from exploding in class just because of what's said, how can you hope to control yourself during a mission?"

"I..." the girl blushed slightly before looking down, fidgeting lightly where she sat before falling silent.

"Yeesh, Forehead," a blonde haired girl sitting a few seats away called out, her blue eyes sparkling with a bit of sadistic amusement, "You keep acting this way and Sasuke-kun will be all mine before you know it!"

"Ino-pig..." The girl growled back in response as she glared warningly back at the girl.

"Both of you shut up already," the words were cold as they shot out of the mouth of a black haired, black eyed boy who never even bothered to look at them as he spoke, "I have no interest in either of you."</pre>

<pre>Harry got up and retrieved two Butterbeers from the pantry, sliding one across the table. "You enjoy dueling, then?"

Tonks brushed an imaginary piece of lint off her shoulder. "Kid, you're looking at the only Junior Auror to ever place top ten in DMLE friendlies!"

Harry thought back to how he nearly had his ass handed to him by a Goyle. "Maybe you could give me a few pointers some time."

"Right, your godfather did tell me you were ace at Defense," Tonks said, leaning over the table. "How about a proper duel once things settle down?"

Harry waved her off. "Not happening. You're a fully-trained Auror now—we both know how it would end."

"Come on, Harry," Tonks whined. "I could use some practice so I don't get rusty. Don't tell me you're afraid of fighting little ol' me?"

Harry groaned. His misguided attempt to bond over a common hobby had awakened a monster. Was Tonks so keen on dueling because she had something to prove to her colleagues?

"I suppose we could," he said with a resigned sigh.

"That's the spirit!" she cheered. "Wanna spice things up with a friendly wager?"

The glint in her eyes was making him wary. "Like what?"

She smiled gleefully. "If I win, you become my lackey for a day. You'd have to bring me refreshments, paint my toenails, rub my feet—"

"I'm in," Harry said.

Tonks gave him a odd look. "We haven't agreed on my stake yet."

"Oh, right," he said with a nervous chuckle. Truth be told, he didn't expect to win, and it looked like he'd be getting a reward in any case. "How about, you'll have to go out with me transformed into whoever I want?"

Tonks snorted and tossed her hair back. "You little rascal. Fine, let's go with that—it's not like you can beat me."

Harry privately agreed, but hearing her say it was irritating. He resolved to give it his best shot.

They faced off in the dim basement of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, Harry tense, and Tonks relaxed and smiling. The junk amassed by generations of Blacks had been shoved against the walls, and a boundary the size of a standard dueling platform was outlined on the floor in chalk.

Sirius was on the sidelines, seated on a reinforced oak chest. Noticing his godson's gaze, he held up a banner which said 'Go Harry', and grinned.

"Isn't the judge supposed to be impartial?" Tonks asked, shooting him an amused look.

"You've been getting too big for your britches, cousin," Sirius said. "I want you taken down a peg."

Tonks snorted, smoothed down her Muggle-style jacket. "Fat chance."</pre>

<pre>"Lucy and his ilk must've Apparated away," Sirius said, sounding a bit out of breath. "I can Side-Along you as soon as we're past the guard post."

They quickened their steps and Harry began to smile at their good fortune, but then the fireplaces set against the walls roared to life, belching out red-robed Aurors.

"Run!" Sirius shouted, leading by example.

They sprinted towards the security desk and vaulted over its barrier, but before Sirius could turn on the spot, he was downed by a spell. Harry had to jump away from his godfather to avoid several off-course Stunners.

Red-robed wizards kept Flooing in, interspersed with an occasional Ministry bureaucrat in more casual robes, until the avalanche ended with the arrival of Fudge himself. The Minister listened to an Auror whisper something into his ear while staring grimly at the stunned and bound Sirius. The Aurors formed a circle around him, making it impossible for Harry to do anything without revealing himself.

"I knew it was Black all along, I knew it," Fudge said, twirling his bowler hat on a finger. "Excellent work, men. With his capture, all those ridiculous rumors about Lord Thingy will be put to rest."

"Shall we move him to the holding cells?" Kingsley Shacklebolt asked.

"Oh no, Black's way too dangerous for that!" Fudge said. "Wilkins, Floo Azkaban and tell them to send over a Dementor. I'm not letting this terrorist slip away again."

Harry's stomach sank. He yanked the cloak off, eliciting surprised cries from the Aurors and becoming a target of dozens of wands.

"You're making a mistake, Minister," he said, putting his hands up to show he was unarmed. "Sirius is an innocent man. He was only here to stop Malfoy and the other Death Eaters—"

"Harry Potter?" Fudge gaped at him before tittering. "What utter tosh! Don't worry, my boy, St. Mungo's will set you to rights. Certainly won't be the first Confundus case they've dealt with."

Harry growled, feeling like he could've managed a decent Killing Curse at that moment. Sure, he hated the Death Eaters too, but this muppet was supposed to be on his side.

A single fireplace flared green, startling Harry out of his attempt to spontaneously develop the power to blow people's heads up with his mind. The Minister turned to watch the one called Wilkins emerge from the flames.

"T-the guards are g-gone," stammered the ashen-faced man. "His m-mark flies over Azkaban."

"My good man, what are you babbling about?" Fudge exclaimed. "Whose mark is at Azkaban?"

"You-Know-Who's," Wilkins said, his eyes round with fear.

"I don't, that's why I asked—" Fudge blanched and went silent. He looked at Sirius, then at Harry, gripping his hat so hard his fingers turned white. "B-but... t-that means..."

"Man, I wish I had a camera right now," Harry said, grinning widely.</pre>

<pre>The headmaster emerged holding a gilded tome inscribed with gothic lettering, which he placed reverently on the desk. Minerva scooted closer and observed with interest as Dumbledore cracked the book open and leafed through. It didn't take him long to locate the relevant part, for which Harry was grateful as his heart was about to explode from the tension.

"Chapter XII, Part I," Dumbledore cited, "carrying out an unauthorized ritual on Hogwarts grounds. Taking some liberties in translating the archaic language, Mr. Potter, your punishment is a choice between eleven cows, to be handed off to the Keeper of the Grounds; a fine of seven golden Galleons; or, wearing the Mask of Shame for the duration of one month."

Harry gaped in silence as Dumbledore dived back into his bottomless drawer and surfaced with a rusty metallic contraption that looked like a medieval torture device. Were these old farts playing a joke on him?

"Only seven Galleons?" he asked weakly. It was costly, sure, but nothing he couldn't pay without even having to visit Gringotts.

"Inflation, Mr. Potter," McGonagall said. "A few centuries back, that would've been enough to purchase a small house."

"I'll take the fine," he said in a firmer voice, eyeing the mask and wondering if the spiky bits were just for decoration.

Dumbledore looked mildly disappointed as he removed the contraption from his desk. "Quite understandable. Why, Willie Felterbush did the same back in the sixties. Do you recall the case, Minerva?"

"How could I forget," she said dryly. "The one with five virgin sacrifices."

"That guy sacrificed five people?" Harry asked incredulously.

Dumbledore chuckled. "No, nothing of the sort. Young Mr. Felterbush and the four witches who accompanied him sacrificed their virginities. Frankly, I doubt there was any purpose in that ritual beyond the obvious."

"Damn, that definitely sounds more fun than what I came up with," Harry muttered to himself.

McGonagall looked up sharply. "Am I to understand that the rite you attempted was of your own creation, Mr. Potter?"

Dumbledore leaned forward, also appearing interested in the answer. Harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. It hadn't occurred to him that the professors would be under the assumption he'd followed the instructions from a book or some such.

+

"Potter is under suspicion of dabbling in forbidden magic, and, as such, shall be tried by the Wizengamot," Umbridge continued, pointing a pudgy finger at the boy. "Furthermore, he's to be suspended from Hogwarts and confined to his home until the date of the court hearing. Aurors, snap his wand!"

There was a palpable tension in the office as Dumbledore half-rose behind his desk, his imposing height already putting him above Umbridge. The Aurors stiffened and glanced at each other uncomfortably before the male one cleared his throat.

"This isn't in accordance with the procedure, Madam Undersecretary. Mr. Potter's expulsion hasn't been decided yet," he said.

Umbridge appeared put out, but quickly hid it with a smile. "Dear me, did I really say 'snap'?" she simpered. "I meant seize, of course. Hand over your wand, Mr. Potter—the Ministry shall keep it safe until the hearing."

Harry winked at Dumbledore, who looked ready to intervene on his behalf, and slowly reached into the pocket where his wand was. As soon as his fingers wrapped around the handle, he concentrated and vanished it into his malletspace. His hand came out empty.

He drew his brows together and made a show of patting himself down, checking every single pocket, then moving on to inspecting his sleeves, socks, and behind his ears. He was debating whether sticking a hand down his pants would be going a tad too far, when Umbridge interrupted.

"Wasting our valuable time won't do you any good, Mr. Potter." Her voice retained its sickly-sweet quality, but she was tapping her fingers against her arm impatiently.

"Sorry, ma'am," Harry said. "I seem to have misplaced my wand."

Dumbledore slumped back in his seat, and the Aurors who had been eyeing the headmaster anxiously breathed a sigh of relief. Umbridge didn't seem to notice, instead narrowing her beady eyes at Harry.

"Lying again, Mr. Potter," she said, shaking her head. "I should've expected that from you. Let's see if we can add spoliation of evidence to the list of your charges."

"I really don't have it, ma'am. Your people are welcome to frisk me—as thoroughly as necessary." He grinned at the female Auror expectantly.

"We're not Muggles, young man," the witch in question said with a roll of her eyes. Getting a nod from her colleague, she whispered an incantation and waved her wand over Harry much like Filch had done with his detector. "The only magical item on Mr. Potter's person is his spectacles, and even that enchantment is so weak it barely registers."

"Everyone's a critic," Harry said petulantly.

Umbridge turned red in the face. "You're a wizard, Mr. Potter! How did you manage to misplace your wand?"

"We don't use wands much these days," he said, "as you well know."

Umbridge's face darkened and her hand darted into her pocket—with what intention, Harry had a good guess. The senior Auror stepped in between them smoothly.

"Undersecretary, please," he said. "We have to fetch Mr. Potter's belongings in any case, so we'll search the dorms along the way. If it's not there, we can make a sweep of the castle afterwards."

"Very well. You may proceed," Umbridge said, still glaring at Harry.

"Please take good care of my wand if you find it," he said cordially.</pre>

<pre>"Damn Snape and his stupid essay." Tracey grumbled, "Mind you Daphne got off easy."

"How is serving detention with Professor McGonagall getting off easy Tracey?" Hermione asked.

"Besides she'll have to do it sometime later." Neville replied.

"Great! I'll do it with her!"

"Tracey!" Hannah admonished, "You can't just leave homework like this!"

"OH MY GOD YOU SHAGGED" Tracey shouted.

"I…what…you" Hannah spluttered as every head in the library turned to look at them.

"Not you,them!" Tracey said pointing in the direction where Hermione and Neville were now looking.

Hannah turned and saw her best friend and his betrothed standing three feet from their table frozen. Their clothes were rumpled and lips were swollen. Susan's ponytail was a mess, with strands of hair framing her face. Before any of them could say anything, Madam Pince approached the and glared at Tracey.

"What kind of inappropriate language are you using?" she screeched.

"I just… I just called Hannah a… hag!" Tracey stammered, "Because she uhh keeps hagging me to do my homework."

Madam Pince looked at the group suspiciously. After a moment she said, "See that something like this doesn't happen again or you'll have to leave the library."

"So, how was it? Where'd you do it?" Tracey asked as Harry and Susan Sat down when Madam Pince left. "Did you have an orgasm?" she added turning to Susan.

"What? No!"

"Bad luck Harry. Don't worry you'll have many more chances." Tracey smirked.

"WE HAVEN'T SHAGGED! WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT TRACEY. WE'VE JUST KISSED." Susan said in a furious whisper.

"Your clothes are a little too rumpled for kissing Susie." Hannah said running a critical eye up and down her best friend.

"Well… we might have…" Harry said his cheeks bright red.

"You were snogging weren't you?" Hermione asked joining in on the grilling.

"Ummm yes." Harry said running a hand through his hair.

"The two of you are going to be so much fun to tease." Tracey cackled rubbing her hands with glee.</pre>

<pre>"They honestly have a place called Illeg Alley?" he asked with a snicker. "Are there speciality shops in some place called Specific Alley?"

"As a matter of fact there are," answered Lily. "I am surprised you don't know about that."

"What is this Prongslet? You don't know about places that you will eventually make your dominion?" Sirius asked in shock.

"I thought you researched better than that, cub. It's a bit...disappointing." Remus had the disappointed mien that was Dumbledore's trademark down pat.

"It's alright son. There are such Alleys spread across the place. There are of course Diagon, Knockturn, Illeg, and Specific, as well as Technique where the mass production amenities are located," James explained solemnly. "I mean Floo Powder is required in vast quantities and can't be made in a Potions Lab, can it?

"Together all these Alleys are part of the Magic Alley."

"James, you forgot one more place. That Alley with the single building in it, what's its name, The Odd Genies Club in L'ogic Alley."

The two senior Marauders blinked and then their shoulders slumped, as Harry asked Sceptic Alley...er...sceptically, "Really? The Odd Genies? Diogenes? L'ogic Alley? Mum?"

"Lils, you just had to spoil that one, didn't you?" chid James. "You had started such a wonderful prank, and then you do this. That's rather disappointing, you know."

"I was trying!" protested Lily. "It doesn't come naturally to me! Don't tell me that you never had failed pranks!"

"You were pulling a prank?" asked Harry in surprise.

"It was a good one too, till Lils ruined it," groused Sirius.

"So there really isn't any Specific, Technique and L'ogic, is there?"

"The Technique Alley exists. We have some investments there. The others don't," answered James sadly. They were finally getting to prank their son, damn it!

Deciding to help his mother out, the youngest of them all changed the subject. "So how exactly does that plan make mum and Hermione similar?"</pre>

Harry nodded and walked in the house and into the living room which now had one wall as a mirror. "Duke Gryffindor you will surrender Mars to be administered by the UN."

Harry looked at the speaker "Erh no. If you want to try to take it from me talk to magic, I'm happy for you to be in charge of it. Who are you by the way."

"Johan Cline, German Ambassador to the UN. We have voted. The decision was for you to turn over the Planet and all methods to access it to us."

"Bully for you. No."

"We can have a security council resolution to force you sir!"

"Look behind you." Harry waved at Death.

Johan turned and then fell out of his chair. "Johan Death, Death Johan. Now Johan go back to whatever you were doing and stop bothering me. Get the mundane governments of this planet to do the right thing and stop worrying about my planet." The portion of the mirror Johan had occupied went silver. Harry looked at Jennifer "Whose pocket is he in?"

Jennifer smiled "Oddly no ones. A true believer."

"Sweet Circes dripping cunt, we should kill him now." Harry sighed.

Jennifer blushed and pointed at the still active mirrors. Mohamed was rolling on the floor laughing as were the Chinese and Japanese Emperors. The Queen was smiling. Harry blushed "Sorry."</pre>

"Language mother and why not? The portal runes work so we put one on a big supply of liquid oxygen and one of JP 8 and the other ends on a rocket motor and launch it and see if it works." Lily sat with Emile Lovegood, Luna's son and questioned her mother. They were all sat outside around a fire while the younger kids chased lightning bugs out in the dark somewhere.

Harry scratched his head and then shrugged "We got that land near the equator in Brazil, might as well."

Luna nodded "Plus I have those runes for separating out those greenhouse gases done so if it works we can drop a portal on Mars and move all these greenhouse gases there and warm up the joint."

Padma sighed "Warm up the joint?"

"Oh yeah. I am not having naked sexy time on Mars, its freezing."

"Mother!"

"Yes Emile?"

"Lily doesn't want to hear about sexy time."

"Emile are you still crushing on your sister? You two can shag but you can't have babies."

"Mother! Aunt Luna!" Lily and Emile fled into the dark.

Luna nodded "Now, Hermione, Padma?"

Hermione shook her head "One day they are going to shag and it will be your fault Luna. The equations and runes work. It could work, at least on paper."

Padma nodded "It will be. They love each other, it's so tragic. I concur though the rocket could work."</pre>

<pre>Harry had cast strengthening charms on the stands when he had realized that he was going to be forced to come. He didn't know whether they would help much; the spells hadn't been meant to withstand tens of thousands of pounds of panicked children but at least he felt he had done what he can.

As the silence began, Harry closed his eyes.

He'd never prayed before, but all he could do now was pray that things wouldn't turn out the way they had the last time.

People began screaming as the dementors approached.

Harry stood and put his wand to his throat.

"EXPECTO PATRONUM, EXPECTO PATRONUM. STAND AND FIGHT! FIGHT FOR YOUR SOULS AND THOSE OF YOUR FRIENDS! EXPECTO PATRONUM, EXPECTO PATRONUM."

Those closest to the bottom were panicking still, but Harry saw a bright light as a silvery otter burst forth from the stands across the way.

Bless you, Hermione, Harry thought.

"THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE PRACTICED FOR. PROTECT YOUR FRIENDS, PROTECT YOURSELVES! EXPECTO PATRONUM, EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

Silvery light began to emerge from wand after wand. Many of the children, even those who'd managed a solid patronus in the class weren't able to create more than a mist under the influence of the dementors collected aura.

However, as more and more of the mist coalesced, the dementors slowed and stopped.

Seeing this, some of the students who had begun to flee to the to the stands stopped and pulled out their wands.

Harry saw a swan made of silvery light emerge, followed by a shimmering fox. A hare, a doe, and a glittering lynx.

Inspired by the success of their fellows, more and more of the students were turning and trying the spell which would save their lives.

Even the Slytherins, initially more fearful were following suit. Harry saw shimmering snakes flying through the air, interposing themselves between the students and the children.

He saw badgers and dogs and even an aardvark emerge through the wall of shimmering mist generated by those who couldn't manage the full spell.

The dementors began to draw back, a rattling sound in their collected throats.

"THIS IS HOGWARTS AND THIS IS OUR HOME. YOU WILL NOT HAVE US!" Harry shouted, his voice amplified by the spell.

The dementors wailed a frustrated wail and began to fall back, away from the pitch altogether.

Harry felt an unfamiliar feeling busting inside his chest. He'd done it. He'd managed to save everyone and no one had died.

He'd saved them. He'd saved them all.

It was unlike anything he'd ever experienced, and it took him a moment to realize what it was. In his entire life he hadn't ever experienced a single moment like this. This wasn't just happiness, it was joy.

Unbelieving, he pointed his wand and shouted, "EXPECTO PATRONUM."

A silvery, shimmering mongoose emerged from his wand.

It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

"The Ministry does not follow the whims of a thirteen year old boy."

Considering that Cornelius Fudge had just been thrown out of office by the enraged parents and family of the children of Hogwarts, and by a concerted smear campaign, the new Minister for Magic didn't have much room to talk.

"I was right," Harry said. "Isn't that more important than how old I am?"

Rufus Scrimgeour had been appointed two days before, and Harry was now, finally, belatedly getting his meeting with the new Minister for Magic.

"You went to the press after one meeting?" Scrimgeour asked, leaning forward. "That's not how governments work!"

"If I'd waited there would be hundreds of grieving parents right now," Harry said. "People who wouldn't even get to see their children again after they died. What did you want me to do?"

"Support the Ministry! We're all that stands between the populace and the forces of darkness!"

"I'm a thirteen year old boy," Harry said. "What could I possibly do to help anyone?"

Scrimgeour's office was almost spartan; there were no pictures on the walls or other decorations. There was a desk and a couple of chairs and a couple of boxes in the corner. The man hadn't been in office long enough to personalize his office.

"You really are a Slytherin aren't you?" Scrimgeour said.

"It takes one to know one," Harry said. He looked up at the new Minister. "Leaving the dementors is a non-starter. People are outraged enough that if you try they'll have a new Minister in before you have a chance to decorate this office."

"What do you suggest? A continual guard?"

"I can handle myself pretty well," Harry said. "It wouldn't take much. One other Auror to watch me, in shifts and I'd likely be fine."

"All it would take would be an ambush and one guard wouldn't be enough."

"Do you believe in your prophecy or not?" Harry asked. "If you do, then Black isn't the one who's going to kill me. If you don't, then you are spending a lot of resources on protecting an orphan who doesn't have much political influence."

"You say that after you almost brought down the Ministry?"

"The Ministry almost brought itself down. They should have at least fed the dementors after it was pointed out to them instead of getting stubborn."

"Two guards in rotating shifts," Scrimgeour said. "Children think they are immortal but adults know better."

"Done," Harry said.

"And don't think you'll be able to slip away and leave Hogwarts again like you did before."

Harry hesitated, then said, "Do you think the aurors would be willing to train me? As long as they're already there."

"I won't order them to do anything. I'll leave it to your ability to convince them."

Harry grinned.

"Now about what you can do for the Ministry..."</pre>

<pre>Everyone was in the common room, leaving it much more crowded than usual. As Harry entered, conversation suddenly stopped. Everyone turned and stared at Harry.

The only one with the courage to speak to him was Malfoy.

"What happened, Potter? No one will tell us anything."

"Bletchly, Blishwick and Murton decided to try to kill me," Harry said. He kept a careful eye on the expressions on everyone's faces; they seemed to all be a variation of surprise or puzzlement.

It was possible that no one had known about the attack. If the boys had an accomplice, that accomplice was good at keeping control of his or her expressions.

"What happened?" Malfoy asked.

"I took care of it," Harry said shortly. "They're in St. Mungos and it looks like they won't be back."

Marcus Flint stiffened. Bletchly was one of his team members, and losing him would hurt the team, although Harry had heard that they were considering replacing him anyway.

"Looks like you'll be needing another Keeper," Harry said. "Sorry."

All eyes in the room were on him, and his classmates stared at him in silence. None of them knew just how he'd put three older and presumably much stronger classmates in the hospital, and that made them cautious.

It was a little like living in a lion cage. The only way to survive was to be the most dangerous thing in the room.

"I'm going to bed," Harry said. He was silent for a moment, then said, "If I have any...unexpected visitors tonight, they won't be going to St. Mungos.

Harry tapped his wand for emphasis, and he saw some of the younger Slytherins pale. The older students were better at hiding their feelings, but their suddenly expressionless faces were a clue at how they felt.

That night he slept dreamlessly, and not a single person bothered him.

+

"A dark lord with one minion is just sad," Harry said. "It's like trying to be a Bond villain while living in a beat up Volkswagon beetle."

Hermione snickered, while Neville looked confused. Harry forgot sometimes just how separated Purebloods were from popular culture.

"Wouldn't we be considered your minions?" Neville asked.

"The fact that you have to ask means probably yes," Harry said, grinning, "But realistically you aren't subservient enough."

When Harry had first met them, Neville had been much more subservient, but Hermione had been working with him on being more assertive.

They were all silent for a long moment.

Finally, Hermione spoke. "Doesn't it upset you, that people think you are a dark lord in training?"

"If it keeps them from trying to kill me, not really," Harry said. "Besides, do you really think we'd keep having dark lords every generation if there wasn't a reason for it?"

"What?"

"Why do you think people follow dark lords? They can't all be evil."

Hermione stared at him for a moment, then said, "Some people are too scared not to."

Nodding, Harry said, "Also, the Ministry is corrupt. If people were really happy with the government they wouldn't be following every dark lord who promised something better."

"People should enter politics if they want to change things," Hermione said indignantly. "Not kill people and become terrorists."

"What happens if the political cards are stacked against you," Harry asked. "People try to start revolutions when they think they don't have a voice. I wouldn't be surprised it the next dark lord tries to get the muggleborns to follow him."

"Assuming that dark lord isn't you," Hermione said.

Harry shrugged. "Maybe I've got a future in politics."

The disquieted look on Hermione and Neville's faces was almost worth the joke.</pre>

<pre>The obvious strategy was to blow past the one boy, but these weren't the duffers at dueling. All of them were fighting above their weight class, and turning his back on any of them would be dangerous.

Harry ducked behind a set of pillars as spells began flying toward him from the end of the hall. At this distance accuracy wasn't good, but enough spells being cast would make sure that at least some of them hit home.

"Diffendo!" Harry shouted.

The lone boy managed to shield against a spell that would have taken his leg off. He looked surprised that Harry would be that vicious. Harry couldn't understand why.

The pillars have Harry a small advantage. He didn't have to block much with his shields due to the cover of the pillars, while his opponents were out in the open.

He sent a flurry of spells in both directions, all of which bounded off their shields and sliced into the surrounding territory.

They were at a stalemate. Although Harry was surrounded by superior combatants, he had the advantage of cover and spells didn't go around corners.

Harry discovered how wrong he was when long black snakes began to emerge from the wands of the boys. Each boy cast the snake spell while the other two cast spells to force Harry to keep his head down.

Snake after snake they created. Two became four, which became eight, which became fifteen before they seemed to finally decide they were done.

The venom of even one of those snakes would make a man very sick. The venom of fifteen could easily kill.

Harry couldn't even attack the snakes very well because of the covering fire provided by the three Slytherins. By the time the snakes came close enough to harm him, it would be difficult to deal with them, and then the others would close in.

"STOP!" Harry said as the first of the horde of snakes rounded the corner.

It stopped, as did the ones behind it. The others gathered closer and closer, but kept their distance.

They were listening to him. Harry had known he could speak to snakes since a trip to the zoo when he'd had a nice chat with a snake. He'd assumed that it was one of the things wizards could generally do until Neville had told him otherwise.

Neville had been talking about an encounter he'd had with a snake in his grandmother's gardens and Harry had asked him why he hadn't simply asked the snake to leave.

The fact that Parselmouth was a rare and dark skill somehow hadn't surprised Harry. The similarities between him and Voldemort kept piling up, so why not this as well?

He'd been afraid that conjured snakes wouldn't understand him, but maybe these snakes had simply been summoned from somewhere else.

"I am not your enemy," Harry hissed. "They are your enemy. They are the ones who pulled you from your warm, safe burrows. They are the ones that put you in danger. They are the ones who should pay."

The snakes stared at him for a long moment.

Harry could hear the uncertain murmuring between the older teenagers in the hall. Their entire strategy revolved around waiting until the snakes attacked, and that had somehow been derailed.

The boys suddenly realized they were in trouble when the snakes turned around and began heading toward them.

They launched spells against the snakes, and Harry managed to graze one of their arms with a diffindo because they were distracted by the snakes.

Once they realized that he was going to be attacking, they began to shield themselves as they began picking their own snakes off. They'd killed a third of the snakes, who had almost reached them when Harry introduced the final part of his plan.

He threw the Peruvian instant darkness powder, and suddenly the entire corridor plunged into darkness.

The screaming began immediately. Harry remained where he was as spells began to fly indiscriminately. With any luck they'd accidentally hit each other.

Snakes could sense prey even in the darkness. Humans couldn't.

Harry had been meaning to send a message to those in his own house who thought he was weak. This was the best message he could have send.

Attack Harry Potter and you were taking your life into your own hands.

The screaming lasted longer than he'd thought it would.

+

"They'll live," Snape said. "Barely."

He'd just returned from St. Mungos, where he'd rushed Harry's three attackers after Madam Pomprey had told him they were beyond her ability to save. As a result, he'd missed the chaos as aurors had come to lock down the school. All students except Harry had been sent back to their dorms and told to wait.

Apparently an attempt on Harry's life was taken much more seriously after one other Hogwarts student was missing and presumed dead. Harry doubted that there would have been as much of a fuss if he'd been a regular student.

They were now in Dumbledore's office. The older man looked grave and serious. Harry was sitting in a chair while Snape paced back and forth.

Harry was secretly relieved that the boys hadn't died, but he forced himself to keep his face expressionless. Any sign of weakness just led to more problems later.

"If I'd wanted them dead I'd have just left them there," Harry said. "Instead of going for help."

He'd thought about leaving them there, but killing them anonymously wouldn't have helped him at all. He'd wanted to send a message to the entire school, and that required that everyone know what had happened.

"And yet you set venomous snakes on three of your classmates, one of whom was on the Quidditch team!"

"I'm sure the alternate will do a fine job," Harry said. Despite Snape's anger, Harry wasn't intimidated. After being murdered multiple times and almost murdered even more, ordinary intimidation tactics didn't bother him much. "From what I hear Bletchley's not much of a keeper anyway."

"This isn't a laughing matter!" Snape snapped. "They'll snap your wand for this!"

"The aurors said I was in the clear," Harry said mildly.

"What?" Snape stared down at him.

"I didn't cast any snake summoning spells...I don't even know one," Harry said. "Although I plan to learn it as soon as I can."

Dumbledore interjected. "I've already received the aurors' report. Priori incantatem shows that the snakes came from the older boys' wands, not from Harry."

"They're all Death Eater's sons," Harry said coolly. "They were trying to kill me."

Snape scowled.

"Three sixth years corner a second year in a deserted hall," Harry said. "And send fifteen venomous snakes after him. What's the likely result?"

"The aurors' report noted this as self defense," Dumbledore said. "And charges will be filed against all three boys."

Dumbledore looked genuinely regretful. If Harry hadn't known better, he'd have thought the man was a gentle, grandfatherly type. But that kind of man wouldn't have been able to defeat the last two dark lords or be so involved in politics and the search for Death Eaters that he barely had time to be Headmaster.

Harry was sure that in one hundred years he'd have master that look of sincerity as well.

"What troubles me is how you were able to turn their own snakes against them?" Dumbledore said. "I flatter myself to say that I have made a minor study in spells, and I have never heard of any spell like that."

"It wasn't a spell," Harry said. "I just asked nicely."

"And they somehow understood you," Snape asked skeptically.

"I've been talking to snakes since I was ten," Harry said. "They're actually more accommodating than you'd think."

Snape's indrawn breath was strangely satisfying. "You're saying you're a parselmouth?"

"A what?" Harry asked, although he knew perfectly well what a parselmouth was. "Can't everyone speak to snakes?"

"Everyone can speak to snakes, Harry," Dumbledore said. "But not everyone can make themselves understood or understand the snakes in turn."

Snape was silent for a long moment. "There is still the matter of the darkness powder. Similar powder was used in a previous incident, one that endangered other students."

"It's a common product," Harry said dismissively. He was getting better at lying, he thought. "Anybody can get hold of it if they know where to look. Are you suggesting that I was the one who petrified Mrs. Norris?"

"The Heir to Slytherin was suggested to be a parselmouth," Snape said. "Perhaps you are using that legend to your advantage."

"I never claimed to be the Heir," Harry said coldly. "The Heir was the one who killed my friend. When I find out who that is, I'm going to make them pay."

"Making threats, Potter?" Snape asked.

Harry looked up at Snape for a long moment, and eventually it was Snape who looked away.

"If I'm not going to be punished for defending myself, can I go back to my room," Harry asked finally. "It's been a long day."

Dumbledore nodded tiredly, waving Harry off.</pre>

<pre>The day Harry finally managed to accio a feather an inch without his wand was a day he planned to celebrate. Wandless magic, he discovered, was like riding a bicycle without using hands. It allowed one to do other things, but it was terribly difficult and not terribly useful.

+

House elves were a partial exception to the wards on Harry's house. Unlike wizards they could find his home, but only if they had no ill intent toward him. To house elves and other magical creatures who wished him harm, Harry's house was just as invisible as it was to anyone else.

Of course, there were ways around this. Harry had been concerned about the exception. Convince the house elf that he was helping Harry, and it might deliver him straight to the dark lord himself.

"How did you find me here?" Harry asked quickly. "This place is supposed to be secret."

"Dobby talked to the Hogwarts elves who knew your mother," the house elf said. "Some helped at her wedding, and met her sister and her husband. One knew the names."

"Still," Harry said. "How did you know where they lived?"

"The muggles have a book, sir," the house elf said. "It has the names and addresses of all the muggles in a city."

Harry stared at the creature feeling a chill go down his spine. The house elves knew enough to let someone find him?

Given the ignorance of wizards to muggle ways, Harry suspected that one of the house elves had probably served a half-blood and had known enough to give Dobby some friendly advice.

The only thing that was keeping him safe was wizards arrogance and belief that their slaves were ignorant and knew nothing.

"Did you tell your master where I live?' Harry asked, staring at the creature intently.

The creature shook his head. "My master doesn't know Dobby knows. He can't ever know. If he knew..."

Harry could hear the sounds of his aunt's laughter below.

"This isn't a very good time," Harry said. "I've spent a lot of time trying to get into my aunt and uncle's good graces. "

"It is important, sir," the creature said. He leaned forward. "Dobby heard that Harry Potter faced the dark lord again a few weeks ago."

Harry was silent for a long moment. The only one who knew about that was Voldemort, although Dumbledore suspected. Dobby's master had to be one of the death eaters, and that meant Voldemort had already found enough of a host to communicate with his underlings.

"I'm not admitting to anything," Harry said neutrally. "But what would it mean if I had?"

"Harry Potter is very great sir." The house elf wiped his eyes with the edge of his pillowcase. "But he still must not return to Hogwarts this year. He must stay here where he is safe. If he returns to Hogwarts he will be in mortal danger."

Harry stared at the creature. "You think I don't know that? Voldemort plans to kill me and he knows exactly where I'll be every year when school's in session."

The creature moaned and covered his ears. "Don't speak the name! Don't speak the name, sir!"

The sounds of the party below reminded Harry that he needed to keep the creature as quiet and unobtrusive as popular.

"I'm supposed to kill him. I should be able to say his name at least," Harry said. "But fine."

+

This boy was obviously just as stupid and quick to jump in without looking as any other Gryffindor.

"Do you think I can have a picture?" Creevy asked, holding his camera up.

"Who are you working for?" Harry asked. He hadn't intended to say it; the boy seemed too uncertain of himself to be working for the Death Eaters. However it slipped out before he could stop it.

"What?"

Harry sighed. "There are Death Eaters out there who would love to have a picture of me. They're all trying to kill me, along with every wizard who wants the ten thousand galleon award. Having a picture would make it a lot easier to find me."

"But...but they can see your scar," Creevy said.

"Not if I wear a hat," Harry said dryly.

He could see that a lot of the fifth years were around. They acted as though they weren't listening, but they were.

"I wouldn't ever give the picture to anybody," Creevy said earnestly.

"They wouldn't give you a choice," Harry said. "It would just vanish from your trunk one day and be sent out on a letter to somebodies Death Eater father the next."

Creevy looked shocked at the thought that he wouldn't be able to trust his roommates. If he didn't learn to be a little more cynical he wouldn't last long in the school. There weren't many muggleborns in Slytherin for a reason.

Of the three Harry knew, all of them were the toughest, meanest and most dangerous members of the House, all of whom had suffered terrible hazing until they'd proved they could fight back. Harry had considered going to them instead of Pucey, but he'd realized that they'd refuse. They had their own truce with their house, and allying themselves with Harry would have disturbed that truce.

If Creevy survived, he might become someone to be reckoned with, and Harry certainly could use an ally in Slytherin. Whether it was worth the effort or not, Harry wasn't sure, but making the effort wouldn't hurt. Unlike with the others, allying himself with Harry wouldn't hurt Creevy; just being a mudblood would be enough to cause him all kinds of hell.

Harry said, "I'll tell you what. We can talk later. If anybody gives you any trouble, come and talk to me about it."</pre>

<pre>When Neville's cauldron melted, Harry was the first to react. The potion caused boils to erupt all over Neville's arms and legs, and it was melting some of the Gryffindors' shoes.

As Snape ranted about adding the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire, Harry began taking notes.

Potions could be dangerous, and apparently misbrewed potions could even become weapons.

If he could only find a way to bottle it, Harry would love to pour Neville's potion down Quirrel's back.

+

There were benefits to doing everything again; he'd come early to flying class and he'd volunteered to help set the brooms out. He'd carefully switched brooms so that Neville's broom was taken by Draco instead.

Draco was the one to go to the infirmary, and a week later when they returned the old broken down brooms had all been replaced by new, more serviceable school brooms, presumably donated by the Malfoy family.

He ducked the hair loss spell, and it was Malfoy that the Weasley twins inflicted with the balding spell. Harry hadn't intended for that to happen, but he wasn't particularly bothered.

The fact that Draco tried ineffectually to retaliate turned the Weasley twins attention away from him and onto Draco and his cronies. What followed was a brief prank war that Harry found himself enjoying.

+

"I think the concern is the...focus you've had when practicing this one spell."

Harry sighed. "I'm not planning to chop anyone's arms off. I'm sure why Malfoy has been telling everyone that."

The rumor had spread as far as Gryffindor, and Neville had told Harry as soon as he'd heard it. Harry hadn't bothered confronting Malfoy about it because it had been useful. Having the Slytherins stop bullying him because they thought he was a little crazy was useful.

"You have to admit that the kind of practice you have been doing wouldn't be necessary if you were just going to use it for tailoring or some other mundane use."

"You don't think I need a weapon?" Harry asked. "I have a bounty on my head. I've heard some of the other Slytherins talking about it when they think I'm not listening."

"There are other ways...dozens of ways you could incapacitate enemies," Flitwick said. He hesitated. "It's not an easy thing, killing, especially at your age."

Harry scowled and looked at the floor. "When the Death Eaters come for me, I don't think stunners will do me much good."

"Your fellow students aren't Death Eaters," Flitwick said.

"Are you sure about that?" Harry asked. "How sure are you that Voldemort isn't already here?"

Flitwick flinched at the name, although he didn't seem to be as superstitiously terrified as most wizards were when the name was brought up.

Harry continued. "They're coming for me, and sooner or later I'm going to have to fight life and death battles."

"Why the severing charm?" Flitwick asked faintly.

"I can practice it without anyone else helping me," Harry said. "Practicing stunners and body binds requires that you have partners, and there isn't anyone willing to help me."

Flitwick frowned. "So if you had this extra training, you wouldn't use it against the other students?"

"I probably would," Harry said. "Because people keep attacking me. But stunners are much safer than the alternative."

Flitwick stared at him for a long moment before saying, "Detention, Mr. Potter, for tomorrow at six after the feast. Bring your wand."

Harry stared at the diminutive professor. Was he suggesting what Harry thought he was suggesting? According to Hermione, Flitwick was known as a dueling master.

"We can't have you forced to use techniques that could hurt someone, can we Mr. Potter?"

Harry grinned, elated. It was the first time he would ever be looking forward to a detention. All he had to do was survive the night.

+

"Besides, we're interested in seeing just what you've got," the first Weasley said. "People keep talking about you being some kind of a genius of a firstie. We'd like to see if that's true."

Well, whatever they did to him wouldn't kill him permanently, and he'd have to be careful to avoid anything causing permanent damage.

Although he mentally tended to lump them in with the others who had bullies him, they didn't seem to have the same kind of malice when they pulled their pranks.

From what he'd heard, they'd even hit Quirrell in the back of the head with a snowball during Christmas break. Harry wondered how they'd react if they realized they'd hit Voldemort in the face.

He wished he'd gone farther back in time, if only to have gotten to see it.

With some reluctance, Harry agreed to the deal. Part of him regretted it already. Ingesting unknown substances didn't seem like a very good way to survive, but if they were as creative as they thought he might find something among all the jokes that might be useful.

He'd be ready the next time. Harry vowed that the fourth time he fought Quirrel was going to be the charm. He was tired of losing, and tired of dying. It was time to work on winning for a change.

A few weekends of having his skin turn purple wasn't that much of a price to pay.</pre>

<pre>Katherine knocked and entered the bedroom and shook her head. She went and got Ted Tonks. Ted called in some medics and an hour later made it to the kitchen "Dehydration, physical and magical exhaustion. That new goth girl is something other than human though. Muscle pulls, a few abrasions. They'll be up by noon."

Teds mirror buzzed and Augusta's voice asked him to come over.

Pansy and Lavender made it downstairs and shared their memory. Roger, Sirius and Remus declined but the Mums dived in. They came out forty minutes later and Katherine got a bottle of whiskey and four glasses. Roger raised a brow "Roughest sex I have ever seen. Followed by some very tender lovemaking. This new girl is something else."

Sirius frowned "Ability wise or like Ted said species wise?"

Andromeda sighed "Both. That theory of Luna's and Zeno's must have been true. That girl is the personification of death and Luna taking the elder wand from Harry and him giving her the cloak and stone has made her the Mistress of death."

Esmeralda snorted "Harry only needed his original wand to master her."

The Mums looked at each other and started laughing. Esmeralda was right. You could see it in Deaths eyes when Harry rolled her onto his chest. Remus frowned "How does Death get pregnant and what will the baby actually be?"

Katherine snorted "Harry's and one of the pack around here in nine months."

Andromeda looked at Lavender and Pansy "Stop pouting you two. Pregnancy isn't actually all that fun."

Lavender sighed "I'll be a twenty one year old virgin in the circle next year."

Katherine rolled her eyes "And so fix it."

Lavender looked appalled "Oh hell no this is Harry's now, next year, in forty years when I retire. Harry gets the cherry."

Esmeralda turned to her "You started that cult! Astoria tried to get that little catch phrase tattooed on her mound!"

Damien led the men outside. Not quite running.

+

The only one this Idyllic time was not translating too was Harry. "Motherfucker!"

Hermione sighed "What Harry?"

Harry waved a piece of parchment "A pox on Lawyers and Goblins. I can't even read this crap. Is it English or goblin? Parts of it are in Latin and some are in some kind or scribbles that I think is demon script."

Death snatched the parchment and Harry rolled away from where she had suddenly appeared "Fuck Death, if you didn't fuck so good I'd kill you."

Death waved Harry off and sat on his lap as he sat back in the chair behind his desk in the study. "You necrophiliac." Hermione laughed while Harry spluttered "Not demonic Master. Sanskrit. This is a contract dispute from, oh I don't know Gilgamesh's sons reign maybe. No one has been able to settle it so they sent it to you as you are the all-powerful all-knowing wizard of erh something?"

Harry slumped and Death rubbed her boobs in his face. "What are you doing?"

"Well you're being a baby so you know, boobs."

Hermione rolled on the floor laughing. When she recovered she shook her head still giggling occasionally as she looked at the parchment. "As fun as the who is the master of who show is this could actually be important. We should set up a conference call with Gran, Niloufer and Mohamed. Ruler to ruler advice is what we need here."

Harry smiled "I'm going to tell her you called her Gran."

Hermione smiled "Go ahead, win me points."

Harry sighed "Do girls compete about everything?"

+

Andromeda apparated back into the chambers and snorted, Yurika wasn't a little mussed she was a mess. Lips swollen makeup smeared, what little she was wearing askew and flushed all over her body. "Yurika dress with your eyes closed as fast as you can. Now Harry do you agree with the solution we proposed."

Harry nodded "The Wrights have the preeminent claim and we found the history for it. I don't know how Bickerstaff wriggled this deal out of that judge but its crap. I think I'll have Jennifer look into this Judge Hogg."

Andromeda nodded "Probably should. Nice Yurika. Do the best you can with your hair and makeup for two minutes then we'll go out."

Yurika nodded. Harry asked "Is this really necessary? I mean Hermione knows and approves of Yurika so what is this really?"

Andromeda rolled her eyes "Theater Harry."

Harry shrugged "Well one of these days it's going to be X rated."

"Well duh, you're so Gryffindor sometimes Your Grace." Yurika put her nose up and Harry shook his head and led them out into the court. Andromeda had her face in a disapproving set.</pre>

<pre>As it was, Harry and Ron were not popular people with the foreign students. However, "Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody" liked them well enough. Harry seriously wanted to pop the imposter in the nose, but refrained somehow. Ron came much closer on several occasions.

Halloween night, the feast was particularly tense. Ron continued to poke Harry in the ribs, until Harry finally yelled, "Fuck, man, do that again and I'm going to fuck you up so bad yer kids will be fucked up!"

Ignoring McGonagall's stern lecture, Ron yelled back, "Don't you think my kids will be fucked up enough, just for being related to me?"

"One more word, you two," threatened the Deputy Headmistress.

Harry held an index finger up to her and said, "Uno momento, por favor, Senorita McGonagall." He then turned to Ron and said, "Demasiado cerveza, mi amigo."

Ron replied, "Tú, yo, la cerveza. Después de la fiesta. La fuerza también arruinar por completo a mis futuros hijos."

"Si, my amigo."

Hermione, eyes wide, said, "Since when in the name of god do you two speak Spanish?"

"What are you talking about?" Harry asked.

"You… you were just speaking Spanish."

Harry and Ron shook their heads. "No, no we weren't. You know, Hermione, hearing things is worrisome," Harry said serenely. "You should get that checked out."

"He is right, Hermione," Dean Thomas said with a straight face. "I understood what they were saying."

Before Hermione could reply, Dumbledore stood up, signaling the end of the Feast. It was then time to announce the Champions from the three schools. Ron poked him once more.

"That's it, Weasley!" Harry shouted. "Next time I see you alone in a dark ally, I'll keelhaul your ass."

"Mr. Potter, if I could have the floor, please? And, Mr. Weasley, please cease poking Mr. Potter." Dumbledore turned to the crowd and explained about the tournament.

Harry leaned to Ron and asked, "Should I prepare an acceptance speech, or just wing it?"

Ron simply smirked at him and turned back to the Headmaster.

+

Harry spent the next hour staring at the side of the tent. When it was Cedric's turns, the cheers he received were drowned out by the Gryffindors singing, "Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die," in deep, reverberating voices. Harry would have to remember to thank Ron, Fred, and George.

"You have committed crimes!" Umbridge bellowed.

"Yes," Harry said simply. "We know that, dear. We also know that there ain't shit you can do about it."

"You lying, cheating, manipulative-"

"Sounds like that one is for you, Headmaster," Harry said as he walked from the hall.

"Dumbledore, you must understand, man. They helped a convicted murderer escape!" Umbridge said, turning to the Headmaster. He smiled calmly.

"I know. I helped them," the Headmaster said. "And now that my secret is out, I think I have to kill you."

"What?" the short woman shrieked.

"Relax. I am only kidding. That is not my style."

"Potter, where do you think you're going?" Umbridge demanded. "The Aurors will be here to arrest you in a moment. I've sent them a signal."

Harry, who was at the door, turned on his heel and looked back at her in amusement. "You seem to misunderstand how things work. The Aurors will come. We will talk. I will not be arrested. It is a simple procedure. Got it?"

She drew herself up to her laughable height and huffed. "You may have weaseled your way out of charges last time, but you will not be so lucky today." Her evil little smile gave Harry a tension headache.

Harry glanced over at Ron. "This twisted bitch has no idea what she's talking about." Ron shook his head.

"It's sad, I think."

"Oh well, nothing for it, I guess."

"It has to be done," Ron said with a self-assured nod. Harry nodded with him.

He took out his wand, pointed it at Umbridge, and said the two words that ended her life. Several students screamed as the spell flew through the air and impacted Umbridge's chest, causing her to slump forward.

"Holy fuck!" one of the Weasley twins yelled. "You killed her!"

Harry turned and looked at him with his brow furrowed. "Of course I did. I've wanted to do that forever. Wasn't she just as annoying as fuck? Who didn't want to kill her?"

"Well, yeah, but we didn't!" Fred said, staring at Harry in shock.

Harry shrugged. "I have poor impulse control. Just ask my psychiatrist. I'm sure he's woken from his coma by now," Harry said. He turned to Ron. "Ready?"

Ron squared his shoulders and tightened his jaw. He looked like the battle-hardened soldier that Harry remembered. "No."

"Good!" Harry sent a bright silver patronus out the door, sending a message with it to be delivered at the gates of Hogwarts. "Because they'll be here in fifteen minutes."

"Who will be here in fifteen minutes?" Dumbledore demanded. Snape and Flitwick were staring down at Umbridge's body in shock. McGonagall looked like she didn't know who to yell at.

Harry glanced at the Headmaster and said, "My band of merry men."

+

"Well, Voldemort will be here within the hour." The hard look that Dumbledore gave him was a bit amusing to Harry. "Fine. Let's call a group meeting, and I'll let you in on the plan."

The students were all gathered in the back of the room, around the staff table, as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Dean, Seamus, and Ginny talked to the Order of the Phoenix.

"You want me to what?" Dumbledore asked Harry, who only smiled in return.

Fawkes appeared between the two men, and landed on the Headmaster's shoulder. Dumbledore turned to Harry and nodded.

When everyone was in place, they waited several minutes for something to happen. The tension was palpable, with people snapping at each other over silly things. Moody was upset over the color of Tonks' hair, Remus was still upset at Sirius for cheating, Molly was just upset with the twins in general.

As they waited, a single man walked into the hall, dressed in a Death Eaters robe and mask. "The Dark Lord asks for the immediate surrender of Harry Potter. He has promised to harm nobody but the Potter boy."

"Like hell," Ron said.

"I-"

"Case closed," Ron continued. "Go tell Voldemort he can fuck himself."

The Death Eater drew himself up and seemed quite indignant. "Severus," he said, "our Master wishes you to join him."

Without a word, Snape began to walk toward the other man. When the unknown Death Eater turned his back, Snape moved behind him and wrapped something around his neck, and pulled tight. There was a struggle, until the Death Eater hit he ground, dead and bleeding from the neck. Snape stood there, holding a piano wire tied to a piece of wood at each end.

Without looking at Harry, Snape said, "When we were nine, Potter, your mother taught me to play the piano."

Harry stared at him for a moment. Snape didn't know that Harry knew that Snape knew his mother before Hogwarts. That was a major revelation for the man. Nodding, Harry said, "Voldemort will wonder where he went."

"I don't care," Snape said. "The Dark Lord already knew of my treachery. This is just cake icing."

"Icing on the cake," Harry said.</pre>

<pre>Dumbledore shook himself from the shock he had been in and he looked at Harry. “Harry, you can not...”
“Shut up,” Harry said with a sneer that would have made Snape proud. “Look around you, you blind, moronic fool! Hogwarts is conquered. Your
Ministry building is now occupied by the Royal Marines. Diagon Alley is a smoking ruin and Hogsmeade is being patrolled by more Royal Marines.
Every wizard that is seen is forced to disarm. If they don't, they are shot. The same thing is being repeated in every country in the world and you
brought it on yourselves.”
Dumbledore's expression twisted in anger and he reached for his wand. Before he could cast, he dropped his wand with a cry of pain and fell to his
knees, clutching his now blistered hand. He looked up at Harry, who glowed softly in that eerie purple that marked him as the most powerful magic
user on the planet. “You've become evil,” Dumbledore spat.
Harry shrugged. “If I did, then I learned it from you.” He gestured and two more men moved forward to place handcuffs on Dumbledore. Just as they
completed that task, there was a flash of light and several guns barked. The light flashed again and Harry walked over to the ash pile that sat next to
Dumbledore.
“Fawkes,” he murmured. “Stupid bird! You shouldn't have interfered.”
He brushed away the ashes and was unsurprised to find a baby phoenix chirping weakly in the hot ash. The amount of magic on the baby bird was
impressive, and not of the bird's doing. Without thinking Harry dispelled the magic and the bird shook violently for a moment before chirping loudly
at him.
Harry sat down on the floor in astonishment. “Really?” he asked breathlessly.
The bird chirped again. He grinned and carefully scooped up the tiny bird.
“Lilian Marie?” he called.
Marie grinned and ran up the aisle to reach her father. Harry wisely lifted his hand, holding Fawkes out of reach and let his daughter collide with him.
He reached down and caressed her head with his free hand. “I've missed you, pumpkin,” he said softly.
She choked back a sob. “Imissed you, too.”
“Hold out your hands,” he instructed.
She cupped her hands and Harry deposited Fawkes into them. “This is Fawkes. He's a very special bird, a phoenix. The Headmaster used an evil
spell to force him to stay with him and now that he's free, he says he wants to stay with you.”
Marie blinked in surprise and looked up at her father. Harry ignored the gasps from the teachers and other adults. It was a long held tradition that
using any spell against a phoenix without the phoenix's permission was as good as casting an Unforgivable.
“Really?” she asked breathlessly.
Harry nodded and his heart swelled with pride for his daughter. Cyndi was going be over the moon about this, he thought. A phoenix was a
powerful talisman in the Shaman arts. Only the very purest and best practitioners ever saw one and none had bound themselves to a Shaman in
centuries.
“Really,” Harry replied.
“This is so much cooler than a pony,” she whispered in awe.
He breathed a sigh of relief. That was one problem solved without ending up sleeping on the couch!</pre>

<pre>"Whoa, whoa, I get it! I'm amazing, and you all love me. Now, let's get this sorted out before we celebrate, all right?" Harry was too tired to fight anymore and could barely stand on his feet with Sirius holding him up, but that didn't mean he couldn't put his skills to good use. "First, someone conjure a huge-ass shield for Hagrid, and put all the defensive charms on it you can. Hagrid, buddy, you're going to be the tank. Just break through their lines and start swinging at those bastards in melee. I want all experienced fighters to use that opening and DPS as hard as you can. Everyone else just use Stunners and Body-Bind Curses to CC the adds on the sides." Harry took a deep breath and frowned at all the incredulous stares. "Hey, I'm the guy who killed Voldemort, remember?"

+

In the end, neither the Order nor the DA suffered any casualties, although Ron did get hit in the nose by a stray bludgeoner and ran back crying for medical attention. (Harry suggested that he QQ less and pew pew more, rather confusing the pureblood wizard.) Hagrid was an absolute beast in the battle, even managing to bash Snape over the head with his shield. It was a shame that it was conjured, really, or Harry would have argued in favor of hanging the blood-stained object in the Trophy Room at Hogwarts. Dumbledore returned last, after making sure that every single Death Eater was subdued, and apparently talked to Harry at length about soul repositories and something to do with his scar. It was too bad he didn't remember a word of it; Harry was close to falling asleep on his feet the entire time, and finally passed out in the arms of his friends before they reached Hogwarts.

+

"I find that hard to believe," Hermione blurted out. "Sorry, sir, I didn't mean to contradict you. It's just that, you've said that the strength of a magical system depends on the number of its followers, and..."

"And Harry is the only one to demonstrate powers like that," Dumbledore finished, a twinkle in his eye. "Your skepticism is completely understandable, Miss Granger; you don't have to apologize for that. As it happens, I have come up with an explanation for this phenomenon. The answer lies with Muggles and their fascinating culture. Millions of people read, enjoy, and talk about the stories that inspired Harry so. It appears one does not need to have magic themselves in order to support its existence and facilitate its use by those who do."

Hermione gaped at Dumbledore for a few moments, the groaned and hid her face in her hands.

"Are you unwell, Miss Granger?"

"Of course I'm unwell!" Hermione exploded. "You've just told me that all magic depends on belief rather than a set of inherent and unchanging laws!"

"It is merely a theory, my dear, and a fringe one at that," Dumbledore explained, looking slightly alarmed. "Our system of magic does follow certain..."

"Tell me it isn't true! Better yet, Obliviate me right now!"</pre>

"If you ever apperate away again without talking to me first and its not to save someone's life, limbs or eyesight I am going to be cross with you Harry."

"Sorry Mi. I got angry." He folded her in his arms in the huge bed in the master at Grimmauld place.

"You can't just shaaaaaggh me out offff being crossssss! Harry!"

Tonks looked at Luna who shrugged "Looks like we'll find out if he can or not."</pre>

<pre>At the Gryffindor table, Hermione tried not to cry. She just stared at her plate listlessly, her mind replaying the picture of a heavily bleeding Harry on the bed, spell-wounds all over his body. She was so lost in thought, she didn’t notice the shadow over her.

Hey now, ‘lil missy; if yer not gonna eat that drumstick, mind if I take a bite?

Hermione started at that, her head and body whipping around at the sound of the unfamiliar voice. The man in front of her was rakishly dressed, complete with an outlandish hat. What she could see of the man’s hair was dark and somewhat messy, and his eyes were almost smoldering.

Ain’ polite ta’ stare, ‘lil missy.

Hermione flushed at the mild rebuke. Idly, she noticed that the remainder of the Great Hall was now paying attention to the man.

Umbridge cleared her throat. Hem, hem.

Yer gonna hafta see a doctor for that, Umby, said the man cheerfully, biting into the drumstick thoughtfully.

That’s Senior Undersecretary Umbridge to you! snapped the witch. Who are you?! Why are you here?!

I’ve got many names, Umby, said the man lightheartedly, biting into his drumstick. As fer who I am, ‘m just a concerned relative here ta’ lookout fer the son of my son.

And who might this be, young man? asked the suddenly interested Dumbledore, watching the youthful-looking man curiously.

Ainnit obvious? Harry Potter, of course.</pre>

<pre>"GRAAA!" it sounded horrifying. Like nails on a chalkboard as out of the shadowy portal a long serpent like figure flew out, wings popped out of it's back, shadows covered its body. Nothing of it could be seen, except it's cold yellow eyes.

And riding on it's back was Hypnos. He looked down at Percy, "prepare to die Jackson!"

Percy scoffed, "why do they always say that? Charles! Fire!"

"Hah! It's no use! No arrow can-"

BOOM!

A shell came flying out of their tank hitting the shadow dragon right in the head causing it to burst into flesh and bones. Hypnos hanged on to dear life as the dragon came flying down, crashing into the ground as it rolled over trapping Hypnos under it.

The God tried to move the dragon away, but it's body proved to be to heavy. Percy stepped over its corpse and looked down at Hypnos with a smile, "yeah, that's right. We have a tank."</pre>

<pre>Hermione brooded through Good Friday. She was still pensive on Easter Day. Umbridge must die. Slowly. The girl fantasised a dozen different deaths where Umbridge whimpered and begged for release but was mocked, scoffed at, poked with a sharp stick by a smirking schoolgirl topped by thick bushy hair. But how? Although the disposal of Umbridge had always been on 'the list', never had Hermione considered that the foul toad would be empowered over Harry again. It could not be allowed. Once in a lifetime was enough.

She glanced at her knuckles, visualising how Harry's had been permanently scarred by the woman's tortures. That. Was. Not. Going. To. Happen. Ever. Again! It was a mantra in Hermione's brain. A given. But how to do the necessary without warning dark forces there was a vigilante at large? Subtlety was needed. How to vanish a headmistress – not to mention the Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic himself – without anyone noticing. It seemed impossible.

Yet slowly she laid out her plan, and a sinister smile shaped itself on the face of Miss Hermione Granger.</pre>

<pre>"So you're telling me that Amos married the woman who infamously got hitched to eight people- who all mysteriously died, each leaving her massive sums of money?"

"Yeah, actually." Diggory replied, rather nonchalantly.

"Did she kill him?" Harry wondered. "Or did he divorce her in time?"

Diggory smiled. "Neither. He outlived her. I spoke to her portrait not a week ago."

"And she told you that I was good with kids?" Harry ran one hand through his hair.

"Well, yeah." the Auror responded. "She told me about how you were a great uncle to Teddy Lupin, and all of the other kids Bill and Fleur Weasley adopted. Apparently there was this one quidditch game you went to, where you managed to keep all ten of them happy and excited the whole way through."

"I remember that game." Harry muttered. "I think I spent more time yelling at the Puddlemere Seeker than talking to the kids."

"Either way," Cedric concluded, "Great-grandmum said the game was very impressive."

"I wonder what she thought was impressive?" Harry snorted. "My expert child-wrangling skills? Or the fact that half the crowd, and both team's seekers were looking at me to figure out where the snitch was?"

Cedric shrugged.</pre>

HALEY: And then I can be with Sirius . . . Cedric… Mom… Dad…

Suddenly Haley's face contorts and her eyes return to normal. Haley falls to the ground. It seems forever . . .

"What happened!?"

"Is she okay?!"

"Of course she is! There are three movies left. She can't die until at least the last one."

"Wow… Thanks for your confidence Dean."</pre>

<pre>"By the way," he continued. "Harry said not to send anyone to watch him again. He said he can take care of himself."

"He needs us there," Dumbledore said firmly. "He needs protection."

Just then a clattering noise was heard in the hallway. Thankfully, it wasn't enough to wake the portrait of Walburga Black.

Assuming it was the clumsy Nymphadora Tonks they waited for her to come in. It wasn't Tonks, though, as Severus Snape came staggering in and promptly fell over on the floor.

"Get some water, NOW," Dumbledore ordered.

Arthur guessed what must have happened. It was Snape's turn after him to watch Harry for the rest of the day. What did Harry do?

"What happened Severus?" Dumbledore questioned, once they got the man to his feet.

"Potter is what happened Albus," he grumbled. "I was watching him in that house. He comes out with a bin. I thought he was going to dump it and I was right, though not in the place I expected."

He picked up a banana peel that he felt inside his coat. "Huh, I thought I got it all out."

"HE dumped it on you," Molly started screeching again. Sirius Black, the boy's godfather, was laughing away on what his godson had done.

"He pulled off my cloak and emptied everything on me, before stuffing my head into the bin. I got porridge and milk on my head."

Sirius fell off his chair from laughing so hard. Even the mild mannered Remus Lupin had fallen over laughing.

"Well, it certainly adds a sheen to your hair, Snivellous," Sirius barked out before laughing again.

"And he said that if anyone else is found watching him, he'd pull a 'Gred and Forge' on me, whatever that is," Snape grumbled, having no idea what it meant.

Dumbledore knew exactly what it meant and made a decision right there with the Order members to let Harry be alone. He was not to be watched any more.

Fred and George Weasley, who were listening in on the meeting with Extendable Ears, fought hard not to laugh. Maybe it was time to induct Harry into their group.</pre>

<pre>"We need an answer: how you found out about Pettigrew being alive and how you came in contact with Sirius Black," Fudge demanded angrily.

"That would require two answers, Minister," Harry said with a smile.

"Mr. Potter," Minerva and Amelia said with a warning tone of voice.

"What? He said that they wanted an answer, and he asked two questions," the teen said shrugging his shoulders.

"Just answer that, ok?" Amelia Bones asked seriously.

"I came in possession of a certain item that proved that there were some… holes on the whole story," Harry said, after meditating the answer.

"Which item?" Minerva asked arching an eyebrow.

"I can't reveal that, Professor," the teen said as serious as the situation required.

"Then it must be dark!" Umbridge shouted and ordered the aurors to arrest him.

"YOU'LL DO NOTHING OF THAT!" Amelia Bones shouted to the aurors, who backed away. She then turned to the other witch and said, "Delores, I'm the only person here who can arrest someone, and I won't unless I'm given evidence of any crime!" Then she turned to Harry, waiting an explanation.

"I got the item from them!" Harry said pointing to the twins.

"We got it from Filch!" the pranksters said as everyone turned to them.

"I have no idea what they are talking about!" The caretaker shouted, as now all the looks were on him.

"May I?" Remus asked Minerva and Amelia suddenly. When they nodded, he asked the students," Is this item a parchment that has a password on it?"

"You know what it is?" the Professor asked, as the three nodded.

"You got it from Filch's office and gave it to Harry?" Remus asked, ignoring the Headmistress.

"Before the break!" The twins said with a smile.

"You know what it is?" Harry asked curiously.

"I helped to create it, so yes, I know it," Remus said, asking Harry for the parchment, who complied and gave it. The Professor opened it, pointed his wand to it and said: "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good."

"What the hell is this?" Minerva asked Remus, with a thick tone of voice.

"The Marauder's Map. We created it at the school," Remus said with a smile, before he said, "Mischief managed!" Then he gave it back to Harry.

"Can someone give me an explanation?" Amelia asked Remus, the twins and Harry, before she threatened them, "because if one of you doesn't start to talk in two minutes, I'll have all of you in a holding cell at the Ministry!"

"We can use your lawyer there, right?" The redheads asked Harry, who nodded to them.

"SPEAK!" Madame Bones shouted at them.

"Relax, Madam, or you'll suffer a heart attack," Harry said with a smile, before he asked Remus, "It's not illegal or dark, right?"</pre>

"In times of great strife and turmoil, I once again implore everyone to continue to stockpile pudding until the time to rise draws near..." Luna's gasp was over looked as McGonagall snapped a stinging hex, making the old man open his eyes again. "ERG! Another year, another chance for everyone to learn exactly why one shouldn't play with magical branches without supervision. We have a new Defense against the Dark Arts professor..." Albus glanced over at the over-dressed, nearly sparkling gentleman with a wide smile, who seemed eager to speak. "For now. I'm sure he will be missed. Alright, everyone dig in!"

The powerful wizard ignored the shocked look from the overly pomaded person, certainly doomed to some sad fate, and began constructing a set of towers using chicken legs.</pre>

<pre>Shifting to Nagnok's office no longer set off alarms, as an annoyed security goblin had eventually added Harry to the exclusion list in the inner wardings. Not like they could stop the human anyway, so having him always aim for one office was something of a compromise.

+

The goblin gave a weak grin at the child. "Your original request to be immune to Wizarding Britain's laws has been expanded a bit. Drake Island has on paper officially become a kingdom, free of all laws and regulations, granted a massive listing of permits by England almost turning it into an approved Dragon Sanctuary."

He sighed, pulling more folders closer from across the table, ignoring Harry's mounting horror as he realized how many piles of documentation was ON this table. "It is slightly unclear if England is even permitted to grant the permissions it has, and we are researching it now, but on paper and as far as we can tell, you can raise any creature you wish, grow any plant desired, cast any spell, set up and use any ritual, even raise the dead and summon demons as long as you are within the boundaries of any wards protecting Drake Island."</pre>

<pre>Harry's breakfast plate of rashers and eggs was shoved away unceremoniously and a Muggle newspaper was slapped down in its place. He looked up.

"Do you mind, Hermione? I'm trying to eat here."

She tapped the paper with her finger. "I figured out how you did it. I knew you lied when you told everyone it was ancient Dragon Slayer magic!"

Harry was barely able to suppress a snort. He picked up the newspaper and began reading. "'Baffling robbery at research lab... Burglars leave a stack of cash worth ten times the liquid nitrogen they stole.' Huh, I had no idea the stuff was so cheap."

Hermione pushed the paper down so she could glare at him. "You admit this was your doing, then?"

Harry rolled his eyes. "Yeah, whatever. Good job, girl detective. You are officially smarter than most of the wizarding world."

"Er, thanks." Hermione preened a little before catching herself. "Wait—you broke the law! Even worse, you cheated!"

"Shush, not here." Harry looked around warily, but the Great Hall was nearly empty this early in the morning. "Tonight, at the Roost."

"Oh no, you're not getting away," Hermione said, sliding onto the bench next to him. "We'll talk as soon as you finish breakfast."

+

She sniffled, lifting her gaze. "You're not just humoring me, are you?"

"'Course not. Come here." He opened his arms and waited. "Come on."

Hermione hesitantly wrapped her arms around him, then shivered and let out a sob. Harry patted her back gently while his other hand drifted lower.

She stiffened up and stepped out of the hug. "D-did you just touch my butt?"

Harry pondered the question. "Hmm. I reckon I came close, at least."

She shoved him away. "I can't believe you!"

"Hey, I wanted to cheer you up. You're not sad anymore, are you?"

"I'm angry." She glowered at him, her cheeks pink.

"There you go. A win-win situation, if I ever saw one," he said with a wide grin.

+

Swallowing his annoyance, he gave Fleur what he hoped was a winning smile. "Would you care to accompany me to the Ball?" A bit stiff, but he wasn't confident enough to attempt any witticisms.

She arched a single eyebrow. "Why me? Surely the witches are lining up to go with the fourth champion. I have no doubt you can find someone more... appropriate for your age."

A smattering of giggles from the nearby girls followed Delacour's words and Harry's eye twitched. He opened his mouth, then closed it again and shook his head. "The truth is, I have no wish to go with a stuck-up Frenchie. I'm only asking you because my mates dared me to."

An abrupt silence greeted his words, broken by gasps from Fleur's friends. Even the Hogwarts students from the surrounding tables quieted down, shooting Harry incredulous looks. Fleur herself gaped at him like a fish out of water, although she soon schooled her face into a neutral expression. Only the way her fingers whitened as she gripped her cup betrayed her anger. Harry eyed it warily, wondering if the tea would end up on his face.

"You dare—" Fleur began.

"No, the dare was Tony's," Harry said with a cheeky grin. "It means a challenge."

Fleur's eyes narrowed. "I know that! You're only asking me because you made a bet with your friends?"

Harry shrugged. "Pretty much. I mean, you might be a looker, but you're also a snobby jerk." His eyes darted around, noting that most of the hall was watching them. "Go ahead and slap me—I want my rejection to be the most memorable."

Fleur looked at him for a moment, then set her cup down and laughed. Harry wasn't the only one who stared at her with disbelief.

"I do not appreciate being used as a target of a dare," she said, "but I am in need of a date, and you are one of the few who didn't stammer like a fool." She sighed, looking him up and down. "Hogwarts doesn't have much to offer, does it?"

Harry frowned, feeling like he should defend the honor of his school, but the words died in his throat when Fleur gave him a slight nod.

"I accept your invitation, Mr. Potter," she said with a mischievous smile. "I hope you can dance."

Sirius stared at Harry in shock, than enveloped him in another powerful hug. "I'm so proud—James would be so proud," he said tearfully. "Follow your dreams, Harry. I had my misgivings at first, but if anyone can pull it off, it's you."

Harry was rather touched. "Thanks, Sirius. I'll become a harem king, you'll see."

"Stupid master's godson is also an idiot," a hoarse voice said from somewhere to their right. Harry instinctively aimed a kick in that direction; Sirius, who was still embracing him, had the same idea, and the two promptly lost their balance and crashed on the floor.

The older wizard extricated himself from the tangle of limbs and looked Harry over anxiously. "Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine. Something broke my fall." He scrambled to get up, then froze. "Merlin's balls—we killed Kreacher."

"Merlin's balls, you're right." Sirius stared at the house-elf's corpse impassively. "Oh well, that's that."

Harry was still horrified, but his godfather's unperturbed attitude was doing wonders to calm him down. "You... don't mind?"

Sirius shrugged. "Not at all. In fact, I'd say this day couldn't get any better—well, unless you introduced me to some of your date's older relatives."</pre>

<pre>Deadpool's honest attempt to break both the world record for the longest running sentence and the most repetitive uses of the world repetitive would have to wait. The Mercenary heard a couple of first years who had lost the way home.

"I swear, it should be around here somewhere!"

Deadpool noticed Harry Potter walking behind a tall ginger-haired kid with freckles. They were making their way up the stairs and to the corridor of doom on the third floor.

"NO, STOP!"

Deadpool jumped into the air, his mop brandished, and he nailed Ginger McGee in the face to knock him directly down on the ground. The Mercenary stopped at the corridor standing in front of Harry and that other kid.

"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" Deadpool yelled.

"Are you okay?" Harry Potter asked.

"Dudes, didn't you listen to Dumbledore?" Deadpool asked. "He said that if you went up to the Third Floor Corridor, you would have suffered a most painful death. Which is pretty bad, and trust me, you don't want to know what's in there. I ran afoul of it on the first day of the job."

"What's in here?" Harry asked.

"Oh, I'm sure you'll find out in a week or two, or about a month, but it's way too soon for you to find these things out," Deadpool said. "I think you don't realize how these things work. Where you slowly learn things throughout the year, and then everything reaches a climax sometime in June. You don't want to blow your load too soon."

Harry turned to that other kid he was with who responded with a shrug.

"The point is, try not to accidentally go into a Forbidden Corridor," Deadpool said. "You don't want to go in there. Trust me on this Harry Potter."

Deadpool slapped a post-it note over Harry's scar which read "third-floor corridor: no go."</pre>

<pre>Peter awoke to a slap across the face, meaning the next seven were unfair and should never have happened in his opinion.

"Hi ya, Wormy!" a voice said cheerfully.

The man's pupils shrank to pin pricks. "James?"

"He's seeing things."

"Do you think a few more hits will cure him?" an unfamiliar female voice said thoughtfully.

"Couldn't hurt."

Peter begged to differ, it certainly could and did hurt. "Harry?" he ventured.

"Bingo!" the boy cheered. "You were right, my dear, hitting him did cure him."</pre>

<pre>"Ronald," the Headmaster began, setting aside the girl's odd behavior. "Why don't you begin."

"Harry's never even been kissed," Ron stated. "Unless you count Hermione giving him one on the cheek."

"Thank you, Ronald," Dumbledore said with a smile that suggested all doubts had been put to rest. "Now-"

He was interrupted again when the door opened to admit the guards that had been assigned to watch Privet Drive for the beginning of the meeting.

"What'd I miss?" Tonks asked, flopping into her chair.

"They think Harry's a virgin," Hermione spoke, not looking up from her book.

Tonks snorted in amusement as did Fleur.

"No really," the metamorph said.

"That is indeed what we are trying to determine," Dumbledore said gravely.

"You're kidding, right?" Tonks asked, staring at the old man as if he had grown a second head.

"I am not," he said gravely.

"He is not," Tonks said, aping both his tone and voice.

"What did you do!" Molly accused. "You . . . you . . . scarlet woman!"

"What I did was my job," Tonks replied. "I made a deal with him, he doesn't sneak out without me and I don't interfere in his personal life. It's the same deal we have with any kids assigned a protection detail. We're there to protect them, not to keep them on the straight and narrow or to prevent them from making any mistakes."

"So you have observed Harry having relations with a muggle girl?" Dumbledore prompted.

"A girl?" Tonks giggled. "No. A couple dozen, yes."

"What?/YES!" The look of shock on Dumbledore's, and those of most of his Order, were eclipsed by the look of glee on Sirius Black's face.

"I knew it!" the scion of the Black family shouted. "I knew my godson took after me!"

"You're sure that Harry is having relations with a number of muggle girls?" the Headmaster persisted.

"Wouldn't be surprised if he's doing every girl within an hour or so's walk," Tonks replied. "Half their mums too."

"You're absolutely positive."

"Pretend you are a rebellious teenage girl and there's a boy in the neighborhood your parents tell you to stay away from. What do you do?" Tonks asked. "Do you listen to your parents, or do you seek him out to have a tawdry affair?"

The look of dawning realization on the faces of a number of the Order were still eclipsed by the look of glee on Sirius' face. Ron Weasley on the other hand looked as if he were about to go into shock.

"Four girls since the start of my shift today," Tonks continued. "Two of them together."

By unspoken agreement, everyone ignored Sirius Black who had, by that point, jumped onto the table and engaged in a dance of celebration and joy.

"Lost track of the number of fist fights he's gotten into with angry fathers, brothers, boyfriends, and the like," Tonks continued. "Which explains why he's so unpopular in the neighborhood, not only is he shagging everything in a skirt but he's beating the tar out of anyone who objects."

"Perhaps . . . perhaps it only counts if it's a witch?" one of the Order members ventured weakly.

"It's something to look into," Dumbledore agreed. "All may not be lost if Harry has only dallied with muggles."

Fleur laughed. "I guarantee that there eez no chance that 'arrie 'as not enjoyed ze charms of magical girls."

"What?" the old man asked flatly.

"Nearly every girl who attended ze Triwizard from Beauxbatons along with at least 'alf of ze teachers," the French girl replied.

"Harry's the one who keeps wizards from taking their girlfriends for granted," Fred stated.

"Boyfriends know the girls will break up with them in a minute and shag Harry if they make them angry," George agreed. "No one wants to have their ex stand up in the common room and loudly state how they fell short and that how getting their needs taken care of by a pro when he can pencil them into his schedule beats having an amateur all to themselves."

"Only time I've ever felt sorry for that git Rodger," Fred agreed.

"N-nothing to add, Ms. Granger?" Dumbledore asked.

"Harry really ramped up since he started dating Luna Lovegood," the girl stated, not bothering to look up from her book. "For those who are unaware, Luna is both kinky and bisexual."

"I see." The Headmaster tried, and failed, to look like he was still in control of the meeting.

"You're saying that MY godson is dating a girl that doesn't mind if he shags other witches?" Sirius asked, eyes gleaming.

"She prefers it if he goes after witches that don't mind her watching and or participating," Hermione replied, eyes still on her book.

"My godson is so manly!" Sirius screamed joyfully, restarting his dance of joy.

"Why is Harry with that . . . that . . . hussy and not my Ginny?" Molly demanded.

"Because Ginny is a crazy stalker and Harry knows that you just don't stick your dick in crazy," Hermione explained calmly.

Everyone pretended not to see the stunner Dumbledore cast. No one had any desire to risk damage to their eardrums.

"How does he square that with dating a Lovegood?"

"Because she's not." Hermione closed her book and gave a heavy sigh. "You don't know how painful it was for me to have to admit that far from being crazy, Luna is perhaps the sanest person in Hogwarts."

"What?"

"That's her problem," Hermione explained. "She's too sane and the rest of us have trouble with that."

"Leaving aside the Lovegood family's reputation for eccentricity," Dumbledore said, still trying and failing to look as if he were in control of the situation. "Wha-"

"Why don't I know any of this?" Ron demanded, interrupting the Headmaster. "Harry's my best mate, you'd think he'd tell me," the last part ended in a insecure whine.

"Ron, Harry's a gentleman. Gentlemen do not kiss and tell," Hermione explained gently.

"Oh." The boy seemed satisfied by the answer. "How do you know, then?"

"Girls do not see themselves as being under the same restrictions," Hermione explained. "Thanks to gossip, I could, were I so inclined, give you a list of the relative merits and minuses of nearly every boy at Hogwarts."

"Oh." Ron seemed to mull it over. "How do I rate?"

"Start showering on a regular basis and learn to chew with your mouth shut and some girl might decide to find out," Hermione replied. "Which brings up the question of why we're discussing this in the first place."

"Sirius insisted we ask you after McGonagall and Molly both said there was no chance that Harry had ever experienced the joys of the opposite sex," Remus said dryly.

"Why would Professor McGonagall know?" Hermione asked in confusion. "It's not like she ever talks to any of us or even visits the common room."

Several eyes shifted to regard the Deputy Headmistress who looked as if she'd just been slapped.

"And that still doesn't answer my question," Hermione said firmly. "Why the interest in Harry's love life?"

"Dark tosser learned about a ritual or something that could be performed by Harry that would make him more powerful," Sirius said cheerfully. "Harry more powerful, not the tosser. But it would only work if Harry was a virgin."

"Really?" Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose. "What's this energy called?"

"Severus?" Dumbledore prompted.

"Mojo," the greasy man said sourly.

"Luna," Hermione sighed, sounding exasperated.

"Care to elaborate, Ms. Granger?" Dumbledore asked.

"Luna has her eyes on a couple of the girls in Slytherin," Hermione stated. "This all sounds like one of Luna's plans to have you-know-who help her with that. I can't even imagine the deviant smutty things she'll have them do to her to have her have Harry do them."</pre>

<pre>“And I suspect you wouldn’t have answered such a question anyway.  Can you and your ladies help the other poor souls trapped in the rubble from the Hulk’s destruction like you have done these two mortals?” Thor asked.

“We can although I’m going to need some Gatorade, preferably fierce grape.  And the males won’t be happy when they realize how they were restored,” Harry pointed out.

It was a familiar reporter, Ben Ulrich of the Daily Bugle who worked with Harry, who pointed out, “It’s better than being dead.”

Janet’s mind focused in on the world around her once more to see the Norse superhero Thor digging corpses out of the rubble while Regenerate and Blend took turns blowing their boyfriend and transferring his load to those deceased.  Miraculously the dead were being restored by that incredibly tasty liquid.  Janet herself felt better than ever before in her life and desired to taste that potion again directly from the source.  Indeed the tap was an impressive eight inches and quite thick. 

“Can I do anything to help?” Janet asked Blend as the blonde took a break from her pleasant task.

“He needs Gatorade to replenish himself.  Could you maybe get him some Fierce Grape?  He loves that kind,” Gwen asked.

“Sure, I can do that,” Janet agreed after noticing there were still over two dozen of Bruce’s victims to revive. 

“Here’s some cash.  I doubt you keep much on you in that outfit,” Gwen said as she offered Janet a twenty. 

“No need…I’ve got friends that will have Harry brought whatever he needs,” Janet assured while indicating her communicator.  While tapping her communicator Jan said, “Tony…can you have some fierce grape Gatorade sent over for Spider-Man.  He’s raising the dead with his semen.”

“I saw it on TV Jan but am having trouble believing it.  I’ll have some Gatorade sent right over,” Tony assured.  “I thought Fury said Spider-Man was just a kid.  That’s no kid and he’s quite hung.”

“Yes he is,” Jan agreed with a grin before ending the communiqué. 

“What is Spider-Man doing in public?” Steve demanded as he limped his way over to where Jan was watching the healing under the supervision of the same group of reporters.

“He’s not making a porn video that’s for sure Steve.  His semen has a healing effect.  It is so powerful it heals the dead,” Janet explained. 

“I see,” Captain America said; his tone displeased.  “Does he have to do that out in the open in front of the cameras?”

“He’s got nothing to be embarrassed about.  Besides it looks like they’ll be finished in another hour or two,” Jan assured with a grin.

“Well I’m going to go get cleaned up.  Are you coming, Jan?” Steve asked.

“No…you go ahead. I’m going to stay here and watch.  The S.H.I.E.L.D. guys already came and retrieved Banner a few minutes ago,” Janet announced, unable to take her eyes off of the tap she wanted to taste from so much, a fact that didn’t escape her teammate’s notice.</pre>

<pre>"Are you certain there are no cameras inside?"

Sirius rolled his eyes. "Yes, just like I told you the first three times. I know what a camera looks like, thank you very much."

"You can never be too sure with you purebloods," Harry said, staring at the sciency facility across the road that they were about to rob. He was holding a metallic four-liter container in his hands.

"Need I point out that I enchanted my motorcycle from scratch?" Sirius asked indignantly. "Not that I understand anything about this LN2 stuff. I hope you know what you're doing."

Harry nodded. "Don't worry, I've read the Wikipedia article. I'm practically an expert now."

"In that case, let's get a move on."

+

Sirius flexed his hand experimentally. "How much can you fit in there, anyway?"

"I dunno—a fuckton. That seventh-year I got to enchant this was really handy with Extension Charms."

Sirius tapped his chin thoughtfully. "We're measuring volume here, not weight, so it should be a 'fuckliter'."

"And you call me a nerd."

+

"It's an honor, Mr. Potter." The short, balding man shook his hand, squinting at him through thick glasses. He had a toothbrush mustache which would have been considered politically incorrect in the Muggle world. "My daughter is a huge fan of yours—she'll be cheering for you from the stands."

Harry smiled. "That's what I wanted to talk with you about. I was wondering how well the audience is protected from potential hazards—say, extreme cold?"

"Extreme cold?" The man chuckled. "Surely you know that dragons breathe fire, young man."

Harry's smile widened. "I will be the one using cold. Speaking of which, am I allowed to slay the beast?"

"Slay it?" The Ministry bureaucrat puffed up indignantly. "Mr. Potter, I assure you that our protective charms—and the dragon—will handle anything a schoolboy can throw at them. You should be thinking about your own safety instead of entertaining these fantasies." The man stomped off, muttering about kids with inane questions wasting his time.

"Well, fuck you too," Harry mumbled to his retreating back—but not too loudly, for he didn't need any trouble right then. He fully intended to become the world's youngest Dragonslayer.</pre>

"Dark Lord! In the hope that you might have pity on us poor wretches, we offer you our finest maiden!" he says gesturing at the farm girl tied to a pair of wooden poles.

"I ain't a maiden! They don't call me Haystack Harriet for nothing!" she says struggling, Haystack Harriet? She's either a prostitute or a slut...

"...She's clearly hysterical... overcome by your magnificent visage, Lord!" he says trembling as I glare down at him.</pre>

<pre>I sweep my gaze over the teeming mass of gray-green flesh, noticing one elf that towers over the rest of them. By towers, I mean he's roughly four inches taller than the three feet of the average elf, but it is quite a difference compared to his compatriots.

"Hello! I was wondering where I would be able to find a horse," I announce, as if it's the most normal thing in the world for a second-year student to barge into Hogwarts kitchens in the middle of the night and inquire about a hundred and ten stone animal.

"Horse? You hungry enough to eats a horse?" The taller elf asks, one eye squinted tightly as he peers up at me. I take a closer look at the elf, who's done up in a gray suit and vest, albeit a raggedy one.

"Well, not me, but a friend of mine."

Tapping his foot aggressively, the elf squints his eye even tighter, nearly winking at me as he thinks on my request. "Why your friend needs horse?" He demands, arms waving wildly. "Horses be expensive! You thinks horses grow on trees?"

I rear back, wondering how to convince the head elf of my need for a horse. "Woah, woah," I shoot back, putting my hands up defensively. "It's for a really big snake, and she's very hungry. You see, she's been sleeping for fifty years and would like a horse to eat, and I'd prefer she eat a horse instead of one of the students." I cross my fingers behind my back, praying that I've managed to bullshit my way through this. I know that if Magna attempted to go out and eat a student I'd immediately put her down, but I'd really like to see if I can avoid that. Ignoring her lack of intelligence, she's still a basilisk, and that's definitely a strong ally to have on my side.

The elf thinks deeply, cocking his jaw and causing it to crack loudly. "How big is the snake?" He asks, glaring at me over his floppy nose.

I hold out my hands as if to measure Magna. "Uh, about… fifty? No- sixty feet?"

The head elf furrows his brow, chewing on his cheek as he continues to glare at me. "We gets you horse for snake, but only once!" He cries, pointing angrily.

I clap excitedly. "Thank you! You're the best!"

"I knows," he shoots back arrogantly, shouting orders out across the kitchen for the other elves to go and fetch aforementioned horse.

A snap and a flash of light announces the arrival of said horse, landing bound and confused in the middle of the kitchen. Instantly, the horse starts screaming in fear.

Flinching at the terrible noise, I snap off a silencio and put the animal on mute.

Okay, so… time to figure out how to get this back to the Chamber.

I sit for a few minutes, ignoring the cacophony of the elves completing their late-night prep work. Hundreds of knives chop and dice vegetables around me, pots filled with broths and gravies bubble and spit as they're taken on or off the flame.

I stick my fingers in my ears childishly pushing the sounds out of my head. The only way to get the horse over to the chamber that I can readily think of would be to simply levitate it. Would a mobilicorpus work on a horse though? Only one way to find out.

I wave my wand, cursing loudly when nothing happens. "Son of a bitch!" I cry, grabbing fistfuls of my hair in frustration. It would have probably been easier to just kill the fucking basilisk.

Wondering where the hell my life went wrong, I levitate the horse and begin my trek back to Myrtle's bathroom. I struggle with the unwieldly load. I don't lack the power to carry it, by any means, I just don't have an incredible degree of control over it, like trying to carry a very wide, but light object. One has the tendency to bump into everything along the way.

I finally make it to the second floor, my slow-going travels interrupted by a demanding, nasally voice.

"Excuse me, what… what the hell are you doing?"

Glancing over my shoulder I spy Percy Weasley looking absolutely and completely dumbfounded.

I freeze up. What do I say? Seriously, what do I say? I could stun him I guess. I've never particularly liked Percy, especially after he sold his family out so readily in fifth-year. Could I maybe just make a ridiculous excuse and hope that it works?

Cross my fingers mentally, I reply with the horrible, horrible answer of, "Charms homework." I begin to walk off confidently. I just have to pretend like what I'm doing is completely and totally normal and nobody will question me… I hope.

Of course, this doesn't work.

Percy grabs a hold of my arm, twisting me around and causing me to lose concentration on my spell, slamming the horse into the wall before dropping it loudly on the ground. "Look what you made me do!" I cry angrily, gesturing towards the terrified horse that is now lying on the ground, nostrils flared and legs bucking wildly as it struggles against the ropes. "I finally learned how to levitate something over half a ton and you had to go and make me drop it!"

Befuddled, Percy looks at me, then to the horse, then back to me. "Wait… were you not lying when you said you were doing charms homework?" He asks incredulously, a look of confused horror on his face as he stares at the panicking equine.

I smile, deeply happy that he's taken the bait. "No, I wasn't lying. Professor Flitwick has been tutoring me ahead of the class schedule and this was his idea of a joke," I swear, gesturing angrily towards the frantic horse that is still trying to right itself and failing miserably, hooves scuffing loudly against the floor.

"But… but why are you out after curfew?"

I shrug. "Like I said, his idea of a joke. He thought it would put more stress on me to levitate it under pressure."

Either I'm fantastic at lying, or Percy is the most gullible person I've met in my entire life.

Percy rubs his nose, still staring at the horse. He turns to me, squaring his shoulders and trying to regain some semblance of authority. "Er, well. Good luck with your homework… and don't let me catch you out after curfew again young lady!" Percy admonishes, wagging his finger as he wanders off to go question his life, most likely very proud that he got the last word in.

I know I'm going to question where my life is going when this is all finally over with.</pre>

<pre>"Eat up," Harry announced passing the eggs away from Katie.

"We're not going to wait for the others?" Remus asked.

Harry looked at Katie shrewdly. "That's a good question. How long do you think we should wait before sending Kreacher in after them?"

"I say send him now," Katie said with a shrug.

"Does Sirius or Melody need to sleep in?" Remus wondered.

"They're not sleeping now," Harry said with an indicative shake of his head.

Remus nodded in understanding. Tonks answered, "Yeah, I think now sounds good."

"Kreacher," Harry called out once more beckoning the elf. Harry turned towards the others, "How should we do this?"

Katie looked confused while Remus suggested, "Ice water?"

"Bullhorn?" Tonks offered.

Katie saw the others turn to her and shrugged, "Quietly and calmly?"

Harry shook his head in amazement at the sheer audacity of Katie's suggestion. He turned to the elf, "Tell Sirius and Melody we're having breakfast. If you have to slap Sirius with a fish a few times to get his attention, then please feel free. But no messing with Melody."

"Certainly, Master," Kreacher popped away.

"Slap him with a fish?" Tonks asked with a grin.

Harry shrugged. "Ice water and bullhorn felt a bit… uninspired."

With a pop a shirtless Sirius apparated right next to Harry. "What the hell?"

"Good morning, Lord Black," Harry greeted.

Sirius' anger disappeared automatically every time Harry addressed him with the honorific. "Dammit." Sirius couldn't help but grin. "Morning, Katie, Tonks, Remus. Did you tell that demented elf to do that?"

Harry shrugged. "I might have offered a suggestion on one way to grab your attention."

"Stab me in the ass with a swordfish?"

Harry looked at others and frowned. "Hmm. We may need to be exceedingly precise in our instructions to Kreacher."

"Yeah, I wouldn't trust him not to poison the food," Sirius agreed just before apparating back to his bedroom.

+

Dobby's head faded into view, peering over Harry's shoulder. He smiled and nodded. "Hi, Mr. Fucker," before a snap of his fingers faded him back into invisibility.

"The magic appears to come from you," Tom commented. "And from the house elf bond you can convey all your intentions without a word. I'll admit I may not have ever considered that."

Regulus saw no one else seemed fazed but had to ask. "Did that elf just call him Mr. Fucker?" When no one answered him, he turned to Tom. "Can I call you Mr. Fucker?"

Tom paused. "Yes, provided you never call me Riddlebottom."

Regulus started and stopped a couple times. "I'm going to need to think on this."</pre>

<pre>"Bella," Harry croaked.

Bellatrix was startled. "H-how did you not die?" she demanded, staring at Harry, her violet eyes wide and suspicious.

"Apparently I was a horcrux from the Lost War," Harry said.

Harry had expected her to demand more details, but instead, she fell on him and began kissing him unrestrainedly. Harry found that he had very little strength, but he managed to bring his arms up and wrap them around her as her fervor continued undiminished for several moments. Eventually, she was content to lie atop of Harry in his embrace.

"Merlin's beard!" came the voice of one of the Weasley twins. "She snogging that corpse!"

Harry felt Bellatrix stiffen.

Before Bellatrix could react, though, Rose Potter's voice interceded. "If you had paid attention, you would have noticed that Harry suddenly came back to life. And, even if she had been snogging a dead body, it would be very rude to call attention to it!"

"Well, it wouldn't be very humorous to point it out if Harry was actually dead, would it?" one of the twins retorted. "Thus, the fact that we pointed it out is proof that we knew that Harry was alive."</pre>

<pre>"I was intrigued by your invitation," McGonagall said, accepting a lemon drop and taking one of the many seats that had been set up around the office. "Before more of your guests arrive, I wondered if I might ask a question."

"Of course," Albus said, spreading his hands, signifying his acquiescence.

Minerva leaned back in her seat. "Do you know of any way that a male student could get into the female dorms in Gryffindor Tower by somehow bypassing the protections?"

"I personally know of no way," Dumbledore said. "Why?"

"This morning," Minerva declared, "Miss Evans woke to find herself cuddling a pig."

"A pig?" Alastor asked disbelievingly.

"Yes," Minerva said dryly, "a full-sized pig that licked her face and made disgusting pig noises, causing her great distress and consternation."

Professor Dumbledore chuckled, "How extraordinary."

"How disgusting!" McGonagall said, correcting the headmaster. "The usual suspects have denied everything, citing the fact that they are completely unable to enter the female dorms. Unless it can be established that it is possible for males to get up there, they'll walk free."</pre>

<pre>'You killed the Basilisk that petrified my only daughter.'

Harry felt terrible, and handed the vial back to Luna immediately.

'I'm afraid I didn't. She won't ever attack anyone again, and in fact was being forced to in the first place, but I couldn't kill her.'

Xeno gave Harry a very long look. 'Lulu says you can speak to snakes.'

'Yes, Sir.'

Xeno nodded. 'Pheonix tears will suit you well. Come on, you have to pack.' He took the vial back off the shelf and slid it into Harry's hand before stepping out of the room. Luna grabbed Harry's free hand again and dragged him back out too.

'But I didn't-'

'You'll upset us if you don't take it.' She whispered, before giggling, then saying in a louder voice, 'Come on, your trunk is in shambles and Tom is expecting you.'

Completely thrown for a loop, and his brain not functioning, Harry startled. 'Voldemort's what?'

Luna gave him a very odd look (which always made Harry squirm coming from her),

'Does the Dark Lord run the Leaky Cauldron now? That would explain a lot about the floo taxes from Diagon Alley.'

'It would indeed dear, how curious.' Xeno nodded.

'Ah-' Harry cursed himself internally, but thankfully Xeno seemed to go off on a tangent.</pre>

<pre>There was something to be said about old ancestral manors, Harry Potter decided, and that something was that they accumulated dirt and grime the way Madam Zabini accumulated husbands. He sneezed again, brushing aside the flecks of dust with an irritated wave of his hand.

+

Fwoosh!

Harry incinerated yet another pile of paperwork with a glare before sending the ashes to Ernie’s office. Making a mental note to ‘explain’ in great detail to the stuffy Hufflepuff about why dangerously powerful and creative wizards with an entire department of hair-trigger psychopaths at their beck and call should not be sent paperwork, the former Boy-Who-Lived leaned back into his chair and tried to figure out a way to kill time before his usual visit to one of the DoM’s project sites.

+

Next to the window, his black mamba sunned itself, oblivious to the world.

There was a knock on the door, drawing his gaze up. It’s open.

Hermione strode in through the doorway, quickly shutting the door and casting several silencing and locking charms.

Harry raised an eyebrow at his best friend’s antics, watching while she hastily took a seat; her eyes looking everywhere except at him. His inner-self gleefully noted that Hermione was wearing black lace beneath her crisp white blouse.

Harry dropkicked his inner-self and spoke up. Hermione?

The witch remained silent, while her right hand held on to a scrap of paper before pushing it onto his desk.

The Unspeakable recognized it on sight. Desperately, the wizard began to cycle through every logical reason he had planned out for this scenario — ones that didn’t involve the witch in front of him bursting into tears or into fire.

Cn y’u hr m? The question was almost inaudible.

Harry blinked. … What?

Canyouhireme? rushed Hermione, an embarrassed blush decorating her pretty face.

Excuse me? asked the wizard incredulously.

Hermione’s blush darkened. As a… as a… maid?

Harry stared at her. Hermione, he said carefully; Are you feeling okay? Do you need a trip to St. Mungo’s?

The witch stomped her foot. Harry James Potter! I assure you, I am perfectly fine!

Then why the hell do you want to be a maid?!

I need the money! blurted the brown-haired woman, before covering her mouth in mortified shock.

The man in front of her felt as though he’d suddenly ended up in a world where pink nundus tap-danced alongside drunken dragons. You’re one of the highest paid barristers in Britain! How can you possibly need money?!

… spent it… 

What could you possibly spend your entire salary on?!

… b’k sl… 

Harry leaned forward. I’m not sure I caught that.

THERE WAS A FREE-FOR-ALL SALE AT THE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA, OKAY? screamed Hermione, her face a strawberry hue.

The Unspeakable stared at her, then slowly started to snicker.

It’s not funny, Harry!

The snickers turned into roars.

Stop laughing! squeaked the mortified witch.

At this point, Harry fell off his chair, still laughing.

Outside, a few of the less robust Unspeakables began to hyperventilate.

With grace born of years and years of getting the shit kicked out of him, John Doe neatly sidestepped the indignantly embarrassed — yet strangely relieved — witch that all but flew out. The unruffled Unspeakable resumed his post at the doorway.

Then he shuddered. Harry Potter, winner of the Scariest Boss Ever contest three times in a row, laughing?

It just wasn’t natural.

Almost absent-mindedly, he opened the door as Bob returned. The hellhound sprinted in, leaving its half-dead-with-terror walker behind.

I trust you had fun?

There was a dull ‘thud’ as the woman fainted, a foamy trail of drool spilling out the side of her mouth. John smiled; a catatonic fangirl meant that the world was just a bit brighter.

Harry spent a good, long while staring at the resumes on his desk. He had no idea if he’d stumbled into a strange Twilight Zone-esque world or if becoming a maid was really a lucrative career choice for young women.

He honestly had no idea why Fleur and Gabrielle applied for the job.

For that matter, he didn’t think a cheesecake photo of the two-half Veela in string bikinis was appropriate for a resume. Discreetly, he pocketed the photo.

Though he still wondered what they meant about ‘appropriate uniforms’.

Hey boss!

Yes, Donald? he spoke into the speaker-orb.

There’re some people here to see you. They say it’s about the ad!

Send them in.

The door opened and Harry’s eyes bugged out. Mrs. Malfoy?! Both of you?! Daphne?! … The hell?!

It was much, much later that Harry finally snapped out of his shock, even while mindlessly perusing the resumes on the table.

Now he was sure that he’d ended up in some sort of alternate dimension — that could at least explain why Astoria Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy and Daphne Greengrass had just applied for the job offer.

And he could’ve sworn Daphne had added an extra sway to her hips when they were walking out…

Harry shook his head and spoke out loud. What the hell just happened?

+

It was Sunday morning, and the birds were singing in the morning sun.

Well, at least until a hungry mamba cornered them, but that’s another story.

Showered and shaved, Harry strode down the stairs, only to pause as a familiar voice greeted him happily.

Good morning, Master.

Fleur? Why are you calling me Mas-URK!

His ‘maids’ were waiting for him in their uniforms.

If that was even the correct word for them.

Each witch was clad in what appeared to be a small, strapless, mid-thigh length, back-baring black dress with white frills; specifically designed to bare heart-stopping cleavage. Small white aprons accentuated the outfit, while long stockings reaching just under the dressline were held in place by small garters. Around each neck was an elaborate bow and uniform collar, and each arm bore small frilly black bands. The uniform was finished by a jaunty maid’s cap.

In short, the ultimate maid fetish outfit.

The reactions, however, were a bit more varied.

Hermione, blushing, was attempting to pull down the dressline over her legs, while accidentally leaving the upper curves of her breasts bare. The shapely witch squeaked and flung an arm over her chest, blushing adorably in the process. Daphne looked just as embarrased, although she seemed pleased with the way Harry’s eyes roved over her sultry frame, judging from the smirk on her lips. Astoria was in the same boat as Hermione, though some how looking more shy than embarrased.

The part-Veela sisters, however, looked more than comfortable, with the more volouptuous Fleur preening slightly while Gabrielle’s slender frame pressed against her sister’s. Narcissa Malfoy looked the most surprising, however; the shapely woman seemed to be extremely proud of the fact she could pass for a woman a decade and a half younger, judging from her haughty look and strut.

This time, Harry’s inner-self and outer-self were in complete agreement: cold shower as soon as possible.

Hermione spoke up, still blushing. Harry, this — EEP!

Fleur gave the brunette’s bottom a sharp smack.  ‘Ermione, we must show ze Master of ze House ze proper respect! You must address ‘im as Master ‘Arry!

Hermione’s blush turned atomic. But-but—

Unless, of course, you can’t take ze pressure…  mused Gabrielle.

That sent Hermione’s Gryffindor qualities into overdrive. With a determined look, Hermione gave Fleur a sharp look and gave her a fierce nod.

Fleur smiled happily. Excellent, ‘Ermione! Now, Master, what do you zink about zese uniforms? As if to demonstrate, the blonde gave a little twirl.

Harry gulped, muttered a  ‘Scuse me, and turned around to walk back up the stairs.

And take a cold shower.

The ‘maids’ were left alone and in silence, which was broken up by Gabrielle.

Did you ‘zee ze size of that bulge in ‘is trouzers? she whispered, awe in her voice.

Her answer was divided between blushes and hungry looks.

+

It was 6.30 in the morning and the sun had risen over Britain. All over the country, sleepy men, women and children were forced out of their warm, comfy beds by alarms, babies, nagging spouses, overactive birds and the prospect of an early-morning raid into Onyxia’s Lair.

But especially the birds.

The situation was no different outside Potter Manor, where an entire flock of songbirds had gathered for their early morning ritual. One — the leader — took a deep breath.

Twee— Snap!

The mamba slithered back into its master’s room and back into its basket, contentedly swallowing its breakfast. You’d think those birds would finally get a clue after the last fifteen times that happened.

The damage was already done, though, and a bleary-eyed Harry Potter struggled out of bed.

Four hours of sleep, a lack of coffee and some idiot attempting to summon an Aspect of Pazuzu would do that to anyone.

The wizard, now standing, looked back and forth between his closet and his bed. With Herculean effort, he pulled his eyes away from the warm, comfy piece of furniture and trudged over to the closet door.

Good morning, Master, came a pleasant, aristocratic woman’s voice from the doorway. Still addled with sleep, Harry only grunted.

There’s no need for that, Master. I’ve already laid out your clothes.

Another grunt. Harry staggered over to the nearby chair, where his robe, shirt, trousers, socks and shoes were already set out. Had he been more coherent, he might’ve asked why his black silk boxers were set out as well.

What was next? Right, a shower.

He staggered out, giving a thankful grunt to his ‘maid’. Fuzzily, his mind tried to piece together which of his housekeepers she was.

Pale skin, blonde hair and a rather… healthy… bounce with each walk narrowed it down to two candidates. The innately haughty strut sealed the deal — he was looking at Narcissa Malfoy. He should have, perhaps, been a bit more observant — Narcissa was obviously enjoying watching her employer in nothing more than boxers and a muscle-shirt.

Silently though, she cursed Gabrielle for the incident that caused Harry to turn from sleeping in the nude.

Unaware of this, Harry pushed thoughts of the curvy witch out of his mind and sleepily made his way to the bathroom, where the shower was already running; not noticing his self-elected personal ‘maid’ slip in with him.

The sharp intake of breath when he stripped off should’ve tipped him off.

Standing under the shower, he fumbled for the soap.

It was then that his mind woke up.

Fact: There were a pair of very nice, very aroused fabric-covered breasts pressing against his back.

Fact: There was someone breathing warmly on his neck.

Fact: There were a pair of soapy hands lathering up his front, tracing the wiry muscles of his torso and arms.

Fact: One of those hands had just grabbed on to a very sensitive part and was now lathering it up.

You should know that it is our duty to attend to you in every way, Master, purred the blonde beauty into his ear, giving the shell a playful lick.

Harry just managed a strangled gurgle.

+

What the… Dear Lord, he’s grinning!

Robertson? Rober — he’s fainted!

I think I need a change of pants… 

Potter Manor, at the same time…

The assembled maids stared at the bowlegged woman walking down the stairs, noticing the red marks on her bare neck, the gigantic smile and the just had her brains screwed out look.

Gabrielle voiced out the one thing they were all thinking.

You lucky bitch.

+

Cloneserpents

I think the maids’ first job should have something to do with polishing. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge. Know what I mean?

Now Gabrielle, I want zat to shine, Fleur ordered her sister. Eet must sparkle! So polish eet well!

Oui, replied the younger blonde.

Non, you are not doing eet properly, scolded Fleur. Let me show you.

Oh, does your spit make the task easier?

Nothing eez better zan a good spit shine.

Some time later, Gabrielle exclaimed; Mon Dieu, what eez eet doing now? Eet eez making a mess! A warm, sticky mess!

Zat is natural. Eet happens all zee time when one spit polishes.

Do we clean up zee mess with a rag? the younger sister asked.

Heavens’ no, returned Fleur. We must clean it up with out tongues.

+

Finbar

Harry twitched.

It had been only two days since his new staff of maids had been hired and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could last.

Hermione had volunteered to clean the library. Sure, that would have been fine if he hadn’t forgotten just how much the girl liked her books. He had forgotten to tell her about just how big the library was and now, he would never look at the library in the same way. At least, not without developing an uncomfortable tightness in his pants that came from seeing his best friend, bent over, rubbing her thighs together as she polished a shelf containing a row of books, all over a thousand years old. The sensual moans and whimpers of delight as she caresses the spines had him almost fleeing, if he wasn’t so entranced by the way her behind, clad in sheer, white, see through panties was moving.

Then had come Gabrielle and her waking him up for work that morning. She had somehow modified her uniform to be even tighter and more revealing that the others and the sight of an incredibly seductive blonde, crawling up the bed to ‘wake him’ had sent him fleeing to the shower. He had to get out of the habit of sleeping in the nude it seemed. That she had knocked on the door and offered to help him bathe… well… mornings would seem to be ripe with stress now.

Then, came the sight in front of him. He had come home after an annoying day of Ernie deciding that he needed yet more paperwork and somehow made it fireproof. Fleur had met him at the door to take his cloak and if he Occlumency hadn’t been so good, he’d have been bowled over by her Veela charm. Struggling his way through it, he was lead to the parlor, seated in his favourite chair and informed that his tea would be delivered in a moment. That Fleur had been massaging his shoulders at the time just seemed to make him more tense.

Master, your tea. Came the sensual purr of Astoria Greengrass, as she pushed in the silver trolley which had a tea set perched upon it.

It seemed that the younger of the two sisters had been practising in making her movements as sensual as possible, each movement designed to heighten her form and appear as seductive as possible, leaving Harry blushing faintly, even with his iron self control.

However, it seemed the poor girls wasn’t as used to walking in high heels as she acted and she managed to stumble while carrying his tea over, and the cup spilt down her front.

Astoria! The outraged voice of the older of the two sisters was scandalised. How dare you spill our masters tea after he has had such a hard…  there seemed to be a bit of emphasis on the word day at the office. Now you are all wet and have tea all over your barely clothed chest.

Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair, while Fleur continued her massage.

You naughty girl! Daphne really did seem shocked. You will need to be punished for making such a mess you know!

But, Sister! Astoria turned her puppy dog eyes to her big sister, who was armed with, of all things, a feather duster. It was an accident! I didn’t mean to spill Master’s tea all over my chest, leaving my uniform almost transparent.

Daphne shook her head. No, you will need to be punished! Master? What sort of punishment should she get? Should she be forced to do her work in the nude? Be put on rations of bread and water and be made to eat out of a dog bowl, at your feet while you eat dinner? Or will a spanking suffice?

Harry, going a little more red just nodded, as his self control fought his libido. A spanking will be fine was all he managed to squeak out.

Really? Daphne seemed a little disappointed. Well, since you are such a kind and generous master. Would you like to give her the spanking she so richly deserves? It is your right as her master to bend her over your lap, lower her barely decent panties and spank her behind until her cheeks are red!

Harry paused in shock. Fighting valiantly, his self control barely in check, he shook his head while he swallowed and tried to regain his voice.

No? Daphne nodded and purred slightly Then as her sister, I shall do it. To make sure she is punished properly.

Making her way to one of the chairs, she perched on the edge and looked at Astoria Very well sister, bend over my lap

Astoria, a tear rolling down her cheek, nodded and moved to bend over her sisters lap. That Harry had a prime view of the sheer, panty clad behind was complete coincidence. He stiffened as the panties were pulled down, not revealing as much as some might hope, but as the feminine hand crashed down on the cheek and the count of One was announced, it was enough to have him fleeing the room, in search of a bathroom where he could, escape the scene in front of him.

He never knew that having maids could be so stressful. Perhaps it wasn’t even worth not enduring the lecture Hermione would give him if he got some elves.

+

Harry had only managed to clear one of the Magetower’s bedrooms of the sentient dust creatures, leaving several others in dire need of cleaning. Fleur and Daphne had gone to the closest one to examine the room. Harry arrived just as they’d finished sweeping the floor on one side of the bed.

Now begins ze difficult part, Fleur pronounced. We must clean beneath ze bed to prevent ze birth of any more of zese things.

Can’t we perform spells to do that? Daphne answered, sounding a bit tired.

Non, non, non! Ze ‘ole problem is zat ze dust is starting to move by itself. What sense would it make to animate ze dust on its own? Fleur replied, agitated. No, ze only way forward is to go down zere and do the work ourselves with our own ‘ands.

Daphne looked away from Fleur and happened to see Harry standing in the doorway, and she suddenly brightened. I see, she replied slowly. Let’s start with the other side of the bed first.

Fleur was about to question this, but she turned to see Harry and immediately understood. Oui, she chirped. The two women walked over closer to the door, bent at the waist to get dustpans and scouring pads, providing Harry with a fine view of their garters and upper thighs.

Do you have everything you need? Harry managed to sputter.

I believe so, Master, Fleur answered. Of course, it may be that we need somezing else from you once we’re really working. She gave Harry one of her dazzling smiles; Harry was immune to her Veela charms, but her charms as a Frenchwoman were quite formidable by themselves. She and Daphne then crawled under the bed, presenting Harry with two impressively firm derrieres and four toned legs in stockings and garters.

Master, do you like our work so far? Daphne called.

Oh, yes… I mean, you seem to have done well in this part of the room, Harry stammered.

Zat’s good to hear, Master. I believe we are doing fine down ‘ere. We’ll call if we need anyzing, Fleur replied. Harry carefully left the room.

+

The third task was much simpler in comparison— Harry had asked for Gabrielle and Astoria to draw him a bath in a couple of hours.

As he headed for the nearest bathroom, he was surprised to find Gabrielle marching past him with two buckets full of water, whistling ‘L’apprenti sorcier.’

Gabrielle, why are you carrying buckets? Harry asked in confusion.

Ah! Gabrielle stopped as if surprised, causing some of the water to slosh over her uniform. This rendered the uniform skintight, and the cold water had a predictable visual effect.

Master, I’m afraid zat— zat— Gabrielle sputtered. Oh, you tell him, Astoria, I don’t want to say it!

Astoria had come within a few steps, carrying buckets of her own, which she now set down. Gabrielle, come over here, she cooed, and the younger Delacour dropped her buckets and ran to the younger Mrs. Malfoy’s embrace.

It’s not a serious problem, Master, Astoria explained while hugging Gabrielle. The faucets in this bathroom do not work properly, and we have been unable to get a plumber until tomorrow. So we decided to get water from the spring, carry it in, and heat it ourselves to give you a proper warm bath. Gabrielle was afraid that you’d punish us if the bath wasn’t ready yet.

Well, I might punish you later, but not right now. Just keep going, and I’ll let you know when I’m ready for that bath. Is that understood? Harry asked as Gabrielle slowly separated herself from her fellow maid.

Yes, Master, the two chorused.

Gabrielle, Harry said more firmly, I may punish you later for concealing information from me, he continued as he walked toward the blonde and tipped up her chin to look her in the eyes. But not right now. Just do your job, and we’ll see what comes next.

Yes, Master! Gabrielle beamed as she picked up her buckets. Behind her, Astoria followed suit.

+

After checking in on Gabrielle and Astoria, Harry retired to his office for a while. For all his efforts to reduce paperwork (preferably to ashes), he still had to send in some work to keep his staff in the proper state of apprehension. The click of high heels outside the room broke him out of a reverie.

Maitre, your bath is ready, Gabrielle called. Harry looked to find Gabrielle and Astoria, who had both managed to saturate their uniforms completely, causing them to fit tightly to their curvaceous forms. Water was slowly dropping from both of their skirts onto the carpet.

Ladies, make sure to dry the carpet before you leave… why are you both still in those wet uniforms? Harry asked.

We’ve just finished carrying the water, Master. Not much point in drying ourselves before we’re done just to dry ourselves again, is there? Astoria chirped.

Well, please do so now before you damage the carpet, Harry ordered. Immediately, both witches removed their wands from their garters and started to slowly run their wands a few inches above each other’s uniforms, chanting softly as they proceeded. After a couple of minutes, Harry left them behind to take his bath; if he chose to spend a few extra minutes in the tub, that was no one’s business but his own.

When he emerged in a new set of robes, he stopped by the second edroom to find Fleur and Daphne waiting for him. The room was spotless; Fleur and Daphne were less so, with dirt speckling their faces and arms and runs in their stockings.

What happened to you two? Harry asked, drawing his wand.

The team responded by wobbling over to Harry and grasping his arms. Ze dust bunnies were terrible, moaned Fleur.

Dust bunnies? But they’re not so…  Harry started.

The dust buffalo and dust hippos were a lot worse, and the dust rhino really took it out of us, Daphne said slowly, taking Harry’s arm and putting it around her bare shoulders.

But we did it for you, Maitre! Fleur beamed. This room is now fit for ‘uman ‘abitation, she continuing, bowing deeply.

Actually, Harry replied slowly, trying not to concentrate on the view down Fleur’s uniform, this room isn’t meant for me. You’ll be using it tonight. I didn’t realize that this job would take so much out of you, and I’m really sorry.

He was immediately embraced by both women. Oh, thank you, Master, thank you! they squealed. I’ve been wondering where I would be moving my things, continued Daphne.

Well, I’m going to have full-time quarters for all of you shortly. I started with these rooms so that everyone would have someplace to sleep tonight, even if it isn’t perfect. You should be moving again in a couple of days, Harry outlined, depending on how bad the quarters’ conditions are.

Don’t worry, ‘Arry, Fleur chided. We’re ‘ere to do ze work for you zo zat you may concentrate on doing your important work. I’d sleep on your floor if I ‘ad to—

That won’t be necessary, Harry hurriedly answered, I’m not into hurting my servants. Daphne looked faintly disappointed for some reason, but the look passed before Harry was completely sure it was there.

Could you do us ze one favor, though? Fleur requested as they separated.

Certainly, Harry said.

Our stockings were torn up by our run-ins with the dust beasts. Could you please fix them? They’re silk, so please be very careful. As Daphne said this, she and Fleur both flopped down on the bed face down.

Harry carefully picked up Fleur’s left calf and begin to carefully repair each tiny hole and rip in the stocking. He owed it to his employees to be thorough.

+

At dinner that evening, Harry has some announcements to make. He wanted the maids to continue to work in pairs for the time being, until more of Potter Manor was tamed. He announced that they’d start work on a large room once used as servants’ quarters in the coming days, and that would be their permanent lodging if they like it, but temporary arrangements would be made until then.

Finally, as they retired to a drawing room, he asked Gabrielle about the plumber.

She’ll be by tomorrow, the youngest maid tersely replied.

Who and when? Harry asked. Gabrielle only smiled.

Don’t make me punish you, Gabrielle. Who and when? Harry insisted. Gabrielle stayed mute.

Alright, Gabrielle. If that’s the way you want it. I want all of you to see this. With that, Harry rose and seized Gabrielle under the arms. While she squawked, hee carried her back to his seat and laid her across his lap. He rubbed one hand down her long, lean back while poising the other over her black-clad buttocks. One more time, Gabrielle, who and when?

When no answer arrived, he swung his right hand down. SMACK!

Anything you want to say? The youngest maid wriggled but said nothing.

Two more slaps. Now? Still nothing.

Three more paddles. How about now? Gabrielle was gasping and squirming now, but still refused to speak.

On the fourth swat after that, Gabrielle finally broke down. Alright! I’ll tell you! She wriggled up Harry’s body and whispered in his ear.

I didn’t know she did plumbing, Harry replied.

Only during ze off-season, Gabrielle clarified.

Why didn’t you just tell me earlier? It’s not as if I’d mind; I like her, Harry queried.

Oh, I wasn’t completely sure, she answered. Master, you ‘it pretty ‘ard, by the way. My bottom will be all red tomorrow.

Well, let that teach a lesson to you. But just because I must punish you, don’t believe that I don’t care for you. Harry hugged Gabrielle and kissed her on her forehead, before boosting her off of his lap.

After another hour or so, the maids said that they wanted to take their baths. Harry magicked robes and nightgowns for them and sent them off, two by two. WHen they returned in their nightwear, and was ready to guide them to their beds.

Hermione and Narcissa would sleep in the library for now; Harry widened the chaise longue to the width of a king-sized bed, easily accommodating both of them. Fleur and Daphne would sleep in the room that they had so laboriously cleaned; Harry told them they deserved the fruits of their work.

But Master! Are we to sleep on the bathroom floor? Astoria pleaded. Have we been so bad to you?

I wouldn’t do that to you, Astoria! I had another place in mind for you. WIth that, he led them through the manor— and to his surprise, into his own master bedroom.

Harry’s bed looked a great deal like those from Hogwarts. With a clever Geminio charm, he conjured an exact duplicate on the other side of the room for the last two maids. Will this be satisfactory?

Yes, thank you, Master, yes! came the reply. The two eagerly climbed into the bed, doffing their robes in the process. Soon, all the Manor’s denizens were sleeping and dreaming of days to come.

+

The sun rose over Potter Manor, promising a clear, warm day. On the grounds, the birds took one look at the owner’s mamba and, as one, flew into the sky, taunting it with the singing that it had rudely interrupted many times before. Of course, this took them out of earshot of the Manor’s inhabitants, so the snake did its job anyway.

The sun’s rays caused the lord of the manor to stir. His head flopped to the right, leaving his just-opened eyes to be greeted by a mass of yellow. A few seconds later, he determined that this was blonde hair. To determine whom it belonged to, he pulled down the sheet to examine his bed’s other occupant.

Evenly, lightly tanned skin. A long neck leading to a smooth, slender back, in turn leading down to a narrow waist and tight buttocks with pink spots…

This must be Gabrielle. She must have sleepwalked over from the other bed. And the poor girl forgot her robe and nightgown.

’Isn’t she beautiful, Harry?’

The voice was female, low-pitched, and seductive. Harry looked around, but there was no obvious source — Gabrielle was clearly asleep and Astoria was just a lump in the covers of the other bed. It didn’t exactly sound like either of them anyway.

’Eighteen years old, part-Veela. Any man would kill to have her in his bed… and so would many women.’

The voice was doing its best to convince him. As if in response, Harry felt his cock begin to rise, until it tapped Gabrielle on the buttock.

’She wants you, Harry. She’s wanted you since she knew what her body was for. Just turn her over.’

Slowly, as if still dreaming, Harry placed a hand on Gabrielle’s shoulder and rotated the sleeping maid until she was facing upward. Her breathing remained slow and rhythmic, her moderate breasts rose and fell, and Harry could see a half-smile on her face; he was glad she was having pleasant dreams.

’Now all you need to do, Harry, is just spread her legs apart. She’ll welcome you. Trust me.’

Harry slowly placed a hand on Gabrielle’s toned thigh. As he did so, Gabrielle let out a soft moan.

That got through the fog in Harry’s mind. What had he been about to do? That moan was surely a sign of protest.

Harry scrambled out of bed before either of the girls got up to see his nakedness. He’d have to start wearing clothing to bed in the future. Right now, he needed a long cold shower.

+

The afternoon was uneventful. Between them, the other two teams of maids did complete work on the pantry and walk-in closet that were the rooms closest to the servants’ quarters, clearing the way for work to begin there tomorrow. Narcissa and Hermione did finish the next two bookshelves as they said they would.

After the Delacours cooked dinner, Harry adjourned the maids to the drawing room.

Sadly, I must punish one of you this evening. Narcissa Black Malfoy, you overstepped your bounds by attempting to give orders to one of your fellow maids. Do you understand why your actions were wrong? Harry pronounced.

Master, I believe that I acted in your best interests, Narcissa explained.

Did I ask you for such advice, Narcissa? Harry asked.

No, Master, Narcissa answered, lowering her head.

Narcissa, I do not believe in needlessly hurting my maids — but I must keep them from hurting each other. Please walk to stand in front of where I now am. When she did so, Harry cast a spell — Manos Ligaros — that bound her hands in front of her and pulled them over her head. Her dress was now straining to contain her quite considerable breasts pushing to free themselves from the garment, and her high heels barely touched the floor.

I shall give you nine blows, Harry said, walking around to Narcissa’s hips — the broadest of any of his maids, no doubt due to age and childbirth. He pulled his right hand back and brought it forward in a slap. One.

As the paddling continued, the Delacours, standing together in front of Narcissa, held hands as they squeezed their thighs together. Astoria was on Narcissa’s left, gasping as if in sympathy for the blows to her mother-in-law, while Daphne’s left hand disappeared below her skirt where she was seated to Narcissa’s right.

Standing next to Harry, Hermione’s eyes had glazed over, watching Narcissa rear up with each blow. Hermione, you are entitled to one blow. Do you want it? Harry asked. Hermione nodded and moved to where Harry was standing. She rocked back and slapped Narcissa’s covered buttocks, and must have hit a sensitive spot as the older woman cried out upon impact.

Harry Finited his spell, allowing Narcissa to return to normal, and she used one hand to rub her buttocks over her dress. I’m sorry that you all had to see that, but now it’s over. I hope not to refer to it again. Do not hold it against her. Is that understood? When all the maids said Yes or nodded, Harry returned to his reclining seat, and the rest of the evening proceeded quietly, including the baths in the newly functional bathroom.

+

Harry could honestly say that things had changed significantly ever since the fateful day he’d placed his ad in the Prophet.

For one thing, he’d dropped the habit of sleeping in the nude.

He could also say, without an iota of doubt, that he’d taken more cold showers in the past two weeks than he had in all twenty-four years of his life.

And it looked that there were even more cold showers on the horizon, if the scene in front of him was anything to go by.

Harry gulped desperately, trying to look at anything but the expanse of cleavage Daphne’s uniform revealed when she bent over to fill his teacup. The black-haired woman stood up again, resulting in a hypnotic bounce that would’ve had her pinned to the wall with her knickers torn off, had her employer been a less strong-willed individual.

As it was, it took all of Harry’s willpower not to snap. The last ‘incident’ with Daphne and Astoria had sorely tested the restraints of his libido.

He could still picture Daphne’s palm coming down on — he counted backwards from fifty, slowly.

Even retreating to the library didn’t help; not with Hermione there to provide him with an interesting view.

The wizard forced himself to listen to what Fleur was saying. The blonde part-Veela had just entered, and was now speaking about —

Security? Harry asked, surprised.

Fleur nodded, looking pleased with herself. Oui, Master. We have interviewed ze candidates and we are pleased to inform you zat we have selected ze best for ze jobs.

And when was I going to be told about this?

Fleur gasped. Mon dieu! Please Master, we thought that you would be too busy for something so trivial. We are so sorry, Master! Please, we must be punished for such disregard of your thoughts!

Judging from the way the blonde vixen had purred out the word ‘punish’, Harry already regretted his next words. Maybe later. He felt his inner-self start a jig and chant We’re gonna get some!

He drop-kicked his inner-self as Fleur lead in the Security candidate.

Harry’s eyes bugged out. Su-Susan?!

Hi Boss! chirped Susan Bones cheerfully. The busty redhead wore a smart-looking, dark blue uniform shirt that complemented her uniform skirt.

That was about as official as it got, though. The shirt moulded tightly to Susan’s upper torso, proudly showcasing her gravity-defying bust, while her skirt was so short that Harry was certain he’d get a free show if she did so much as lean over slightly. Topping the ensemble was a pair of thigh-length, dark leather heels.

Harry suddenly felt the urge to stock up on Kleenex.</pre>

<pre>Harry darted past some students in the Great Hall to the Ravenclaw table. He'd visited the Gryffindor table for lunch that Monday too many times already – Ron was starting to look at him oddly. Time for a change to a new table.

"I'm just going to grab a bit of a snack," he said apologetically to the Ravenclaw students, grabbing a whole pie off their table. "And my Pokémon need food too, so…" He shoved a whole platter full of sandwiches into a bag that looked like it really shouldn't hold as much food as it did.

Luna pushed past some students to look at him sternly. "Harry."

"Luna, my Mooncalf-love," he said nervously. "I really have to get back to my Pokémon, we're in the middle of a training session."

"Don't have time to talk?" she said pointedly. "The last Harry had time to talk to me. You must be the earlier Harry, who hasn't yet learnt it's wrong to hide things from his girlfriend."

He hung his head shamefacedly. "I'm almost done. I just need another week of Mondays, and I think I'll have my kitten floating properly at last."

"One more week of work for you, and then next-week-Luna – that's me a little while ago – insists on a whole week of dates to make up for it. Starting ten minutes ago."

"He's back here at our table for more food again? He just left! He's barmier than a whole flock of fruit bats," muttered an eavesdropping Ravenclaw.

"It's a colony," another corrected. "They're both crazier than a whole colony of fruit bats. It's a flock of birds."

"Must you always correct me like that?" whined the first. "How about crazier than a tree full of coconuts?"

"Sure."

Harry ignored them, as did Luna. "I can't take you with me."

"Yes you did," she insisted.

"I can? I did?"

"Yes. We had a lovely time. Five past twelve – don't be late. And don't forget to shave."

"What?"

"You've spent so much time on your new Pokémon you've got a moustache, Harry."

He felt his face – there was a soft down of hair on his upper lip and part of his cheeks. "Well what do you know. I've got a moustache!"

"Amazing," muttered the grammar-picky Ravenclaw. "What a shock it must have been."

"Maybe he never looks in a mirror. It would explain his hairstyle."

Harry glared at them. "Did you have something you wanted to say to me or Luna? And I'm taking this pumpkin juice."</pre>

<pre>"Today, we are going to be reenacting my defeat of the Waga Waga Werewolf. Harry would you help me out?" Harry, pretending to just try to be helpful, pointed his wand at Lockheart's chair, and transfigured it into the likeness of a Werewolf (it wasn't actually a Werewolf; wouldn't change into a person, and was under Harry's control). Lockheart screamed like a little girl. The wolf just looked at him.

"Mr. Potter, I meant for you to help me by playing the part of the wolf!"

"Well, I'm not a particularly good actor. This will be much more convincing." Now the wolf was walking towards Lockheart, slightly menacingly.

Lockheart looked terrified. "Well, I believe you are scaring your class mates, so just get rid of it!" His voice squeaked at the end. Looking around, Harry noticed that most of the guys were watching happily, glad to see the idiot freak out. The girls, also, did not look afraid, though that was because they thought Lockheart could handle it.

"Oh, very well." And he dissolved the Werewolf. Lockheart seemed to forget that he was going to reenact anything. He told them to read their books, and he disappeared into his office. Several guys gave Harry a pat on the back.

Within the last two minutes of class, Lockheart returned looking fully recovered from his ordeal, if perhaps a little drunk. When the bell rang, everyone hurried out of the class except for Harry, Hermione, and Lockheart. Hermione shyly approached the professor.

"Professor Lockheart, didn't you really do all those heroic things in your books?"

Lockheart looked down beaming at one of his adoring fangirls and said, "Of course Hermione."

+

"Harry, are you not going to wear your suppressor?"

"No, I doubt I'll be in danger of accidental magic this summer." The Grangers, confused, asked what a suppressor was. "I am very powerful. Very very. So powerful, in fact, that I'm nearly omnipotent. So sometimes I suppress my power so's not to have accidents." Using the term 'Omnipotent' was probably a bad idea.

"That's it. I can tolerate Hermione's constant studying of her devilry, but this is ridiculous!" 'Well, that didn't last long.' "God is the only all powerful being in the universe!"

Harry looked down, thoughtful. Jessica thought that he was feeling sorry. After a moment, he said, as though coming upon a realization, "You are right." Jessica was now hopeful that she had saved this poor heathen. "I...must be...God!" Just as soon as he said his last word, he created a beam of light around himself, and looked up into the heavens.

Jessica exploded (not literally), "Oh My God! You are so stupid!"

Harry looked scandalized. "Why you blasphemic -"

"You aren't God!"

Here, Hermione jumped in, though she was having a hard time keeping a straight face. "You heretic!"

Jessica started stomping up to Harry, but her parents were holding her back. Harry started acting as though Hermione was holding him back as well.

Jessica screamed, "I swear if you defile God's name one more -"

"What?! You want to try the Omega? I'll go Old Testament on your ass!"

"Try it! I'll burn you at the stake, you satanic little prick!"

"That's it! You are so freaking smote. You better get ready for an eternity in purgatory. Nothing but daytime TV and pinball!" It was at this point that Harry and Hermione cracked up. Neither could hold in their laughter. The adults were clearly hiding smiles, but trying not to take sides. Jessica just stomped up stairs and locked herself in her room.

Harry ended up having to send a letter to the Ministry of Magic explaining that he was the one that did magic at the Grangers, rather than Hermione. They did the sensible thing by appologising to Hermione and then ignoring all magic coming from that residence for the remainer of the summer.

Hermione hardly let Harry get off the couch the entire week. She had him watching movies the entire time, and she surprised him by watching them with him. He never took her for a couch potato. "Honestly, I never used to spend so much time on recreation. But studying seems so useless when you can control what you remember." After watching Star Wars, and having Hermione explain how huge the fan base was, Harry decided to see if he could use runes to make a light saber so he could sell it to some muggle nerd for millions.

+

A week before the third task, Harry was sitting with Hermione in the Room of Requirements.

"So there are supposedly seven horcruxes?" asked Hermione.

"Yep. Riddle himself, Nagini, Hufflepuff Cup, Slytherin locket, Gaunt ring, diary, and Ravenclaw...something." (They had seen the snake in one of Harry's visions.)

"Well, how are we supposed to find the last thing if we don't even know what it is? We need that horcrux." Just as Hermione said that last sentence, Ravenclaw's diadem appeared on the table between the two.

Harry, after draining the horcrux out of the diadem, loudly said, "We need a million galleons." Nothing happened. "Damnit."</pre>

<pre>As Fleur neared the tent flap waiting to be called, Ron strolled over to her. "Hey Veela, what do you say you and I grab a couple of butterbeers after this and party?" He then swatted her arse just to make sure she knew he was interested.

To say the part Veela was pissed would be like saying Ron liked to eat. The order of magnitude far eclipsed the actual words that can be used. She turned to face the redhead as fire danced in her eyes. As she continued to stare at Ron, her fingers started to elongate until they transformed into talons while her skin sprouted feathers. At the same time wings formed on the Veela's back, fireballs materialized in each of her hands. Just as she was about to raise her hand to throw her flames, her name was called. She gave Ron one last look filled with obvious desire to kill, destroy and mutilate before turning and flying off for the Arena.

'That chick is so hot and she's got it bad for me. Couldn't keep herself under control,' Ron thought as he watched his date fly away. 'Definitely going to be a good party tonight.' He sat down on a stool and listened to the commentary while he waited for his turn.

"What? Oh Merlin!" The voice of Ludo Bagman came over the suddenly hushed crowd noise. "Someone protect the Dragon! Aaah. Oh that's a mess. Well, Fleur Delacour was the first to her egg at ... ten seconds. Everyone take a break while they clean that up."

"I want him to call me Harry, and he's not 'my elf' he's my friend." Potter said shaking his head. "That's another thing you have in common with Dumbledore. You both take the word of a man so petty as to hate me because my father was mean to him when they were in school. Twats the pair of you."

That seemed to have touched a nerve. "What of Snape?"

"He's a cunt. And I don't mean that in a nice way. Dobby could you bring in some tea please?"

"Yes Harry Potter sir! Would Evil Dead Snake Wizard want tea too?"</pre>

<pre>The door blew inwards before he could finish the sentence. Harry swung around with his wand raised in response. His first thought was that Lord Dudders had somehow come back from the dead, and the second that Malfoy had found out Harry had Obliviated him and wanted revenge.

But it was neither one of them. It was Professor Snape, and he strode in and stood glaring at Harry with eyes like embers. He didn't even seem aware of Lupin.

"Harry Potter," he whispered. "So you are the one who destroyed more than a month's worth of work on my potions."

Harry bowed his head a little, accepting the charge. He had known all along what he would try to do if Snape ever found out. He couldn't take that action right away, though, not with a witness. He said mildly, "Only a month?"

And Snape, as Harry had thought he probably would, snapped.

Severus felt the insolent response as a bolt through his body. It was as if James had come back to his right mind and stood before Severus again, laughing and taunting him as he had when they were students, and if Severus could only—

Could stop the voice, could shut the mouth, then he would never have to worry about anything again.

He lashed out with his wand and spoke the first incantation that came to mind, even though it was one he would have to revive the brat from later. "Stupefy!"

Potter swung aside from it in an odd, crouching motion. Then he turned to face Severus again and cocked his head to the side. His hair looked as windblown as if he'd just been playing Quidditch, the way James's hair had always looked. His glasses caught the reflection of the open window and the coming darkness, and utterly obscured the color of his eyes. "Is that all you have then, Snape?"

"Severus. Harry. Stop this."

Lupin's ineffectual words splashed against the shield Severus had raised against interference in his mind. He could not stop, not when he had revenge almost in his grasp. This time, he answered Potter's taunting with a much stronger curse. "Alucinor!" Potter would lose the grasp of his thoughts and start wandering wildly through visions, ones of terror and grief.

"Severus!"

Severus opened his mouth to respond, and left it open.

The Waking Nightmare Curse had manifested as a beam of clear light and shot across the room to strike Potter. Or it should have. There was no way Potter could avoid it, as close as they were and with the speed Severus had cast—

Except that he'd crouched and sprung, like a kangaroo, over the light and into a different corner of the room, beside the fireplace. He crouched, with the chair between him and Severus, and waved his hand in a gesture Severus didn't think was magical.

A tidal wave of mice came flowing out from behind the chair and towards Severus. The beasts moved fast. By the time that Severus had managed to overcome his surprise and ready his wand again, small bodies were squirming up his legs, teeth were closing in flesh, and there were tiny feet racing across his chest, up towards his wand.

"Call them off, Potter! I have no qualms about destr—"

Potter made Severus do the second undignified thing he'd done since entering the room, next to gaping. He screamed in agony. There were too many rodents now, and several mice were finding their way under the thickest layer of his robe and closing their teeth on his genitals.

Severus gave up reasoning with Potter. He nearly gave up reason. He swept his wand across his robes and barked, "Congelo!"

Small icy bodies began to tumble free, and the pain in his genitals sank from gnawing to throbbing. But then more teeth bit his wrist, and Severus looked down and discovered that his spell had missed some of the mice, or there were simply too many of them to kill all at once. The one on his wrist launched itself at his wand and began to bite through it.

"Congelo!" Severus barked again, and once more there was a rain of bodies. He straightened slowly. Potter was still behind the chair, as if he believed that he would lose Severus's interest if he hid from him.

"You will not be losing my attention again, Mr. Potter," Severus whispered. He began to move forwards one slow, stalking step at a time, a deadly predator.</pre>

<pre>"Mrs. Potter, in the interests of time and efficiency, I will come straight to the point. As your son's mind healer, it is my strong recommendation that you spend as little time as possible personally observing Jim's treatment and training here at the Temple. Ideally none at all."

Lily blinked in surprise. "Excuse me?! This is my son we're talking about!"

"I am well aware of that. I am also aware though several weeks of research of what it means to be the Boy-Who-Lived. And also by extension, what it means to be the Mother-of-the-Boy-Who-Lived. Without even a formal examination of the boy's psyche, it is obvious that he values your approval highly. Which makes it a problem that you cannot bear the sound of Parseltongue spoken aloud without visibly flinching."

The woman fumed at that but couldn't deny the accusation. "I'm sorry, Healer Baskar, but I can't help it. Growing up in the era I did, the sound of Parseltongue to me sounds like ... like the sound of You-Know-Who himself."

Baskar blinked twice. "You ... Know... Are your referring to the Dark Lord Voldemort?"

She flinched again. "We ... don't like to say his name."

"Really? How very odd."

She shrugged. "Yes, well, his being one of the worst Dark Lords in history made something of an impact on people."

The healer scoffed gently. "With all due respect, Mrs. Potter. I wouldn't even characterize Voldemort as the worst Dark Lord of Europe within the past century. Grindelwald was indubitably worse, and the Dark Lady Echidna might well have been if she hadn't been caught early."

Lily stiffened with just a hint of brewing anger. "Healer Baskar, I lived through the War against You-Know-Who. I know first hand what it was like, as does every single resident of Wizarding Britain who survived that era."

"I have no doubt. I merely note, Mrs. Potter, that during that same period, we here in Shamballa were rather more concerned with the Dark Lord Li-Tsien Chang's efforts to claim the mantle of the Fifth Dragon Emperor and with the Malaysian Witch Queen Salanga's schemes to open a portal to the Yomi Realm and unleash an army of undead penanggalan. Not to mention the horrific violence perpetrated by various Muggle military organizations across Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during that era, violence which not only decimated local Wizarding communities but also unwittingly threatened the integrity of magical seals which had been containing ancient horrors since before the time of Merlin."

He took a sip of tea. "Britain is not the World, Mrs. Potter," he finally said. Caught off guard by his remarks, Lily said nothing, and after a moment, Baskar continued.

"But enough of ancient history. Let us return to the matter at hand. As one of the world's foremost experts on Parseltongue, I can assure you that it's not just fear of ... You-Know-Who that causes your reaction, Mrs. Potter. It is an inherent quality of Parseltongue that it triggers a powerful fear reaction within those who cannot speak it. That is the primary reason it is so difficult to learn. Most dedicated students with an ear for languages could probably master Parseltongue in under a year except for the unfortunate complication that simply listening to it for extended periods of time prior to mastery often causes extreme psychological distress. We generally do not even allow any student here at the Temple of Wisdom to begin a study prior to mastering the third-level of Occlumency or the equivalent." He smiled at an old memory. "Sometimes, of course, that aspect of the language can be quite useful. Many years ago, I once drove off a gang of Muggles who sought to do me harm simply by loudly insulting their ancestry in Parseltongue."

The excitement over Jim's new pet snake died down eventually, and talk soon turned to Quidditch, as Oliver insisted on outlining his plans for the season. If anyone present knew about Oliver's membership in Theo No-Name's "welcoming committee," no one raised the topic. After an hour or so, the door opened, and Percy popped his head in.

"Sorry to intrude," he said. "George, it's time for the Prefect Meeting." George nodded gravely while Fred rolled his eyes and Lee Jordan snicked softly. George frowned at them both before rising to follow Percy down the hallway.

"So how has Fred been treating you?" Percy asked.

"Eh. He's a little standoffish, but he's coming round," George replied.

"Is he?" Percy said while trying to hide a smile "You might want to check your badge then."

Frowning, George looked down at his chest and then twisted the badge around so he could read the words now emblazoned on it. "Big ... Head ... Prefect?"

Percy clucked his tongue softly. "Not as imaginative as I'm accustomed to. Can I assume that you were the one responsible for coming up with the quips and verbal humor?"

George blushed slightly. "When we put the spellwork together, it was supposed to say Big Head Boy. You know, back when we assumed that you were going to be Head Boy." He grimaced at the intended butt of his and Fred's jokes. "Sorry, Percy."

Percy seemed not to even notice the apology. "Big Head Boy. Yes, that is rather clever, I suppose." He turned and smiled at the younger twin. "Sorry you didn't get to use it."

George shook his head and tried to use a Finite on the altered badge to no avail. Percy pulled his own wand.

"I know from well-honed experience that it generally requires multiple Finites to undo a prank pulled off by you and Fred. On three." The boy counted off before he and George fired off simultaneous Finites, and with a flash, the message on the badge changed back to read "5th Year Gryffindor Prefect."

"Thanks, Percy," George said distractedly.

"It's okay, George. He'll come around." George nodded and a few seconds later, they were at the very first compartment on the train. Percy opened the door to the Prefect's Compartment and strode in confidently. George followed only to stop as all the other Prefects stared at him and the badge he wore in shock. Sure, the letter they'd all received had said George Weasley would be the 5th Year Gryffindor Prefect, but they'd all assumed it was just another Weasley prank they'd somehow pulled on the school's Prefect Announcements letter. None of them actually thought it had been true.

"Hi there, um, fellow prefects," said George as he surveyed the compartment before giving a nervous wave.

There was a long horrified silence that only ended when 7th Year Slytherin prefect Titus Mitchell let out an extremely vulgar string of expletives.</pre>

<pre>It was at this point their instructor finally arrived. She rushed up to them across the pitch, a harried look on her face. The rough-looking woman quickly swept her gaze across them, grunting when she came up with the right number of students.

"Good, you're all here. Sorry about being late. Someone thought it would be amusing to leave an animated broom with a sticking spell on it in one of the closets. Took a while to chase Filch down and get him off the damn thing. For some reason the culprits signed their work, so those of you in Gryffindor will be disappointed to learn you just lost 100 points."

The trio exchanged glances.

"I thought they were kidding…" Neville whispered.

Harry groaned. "You wouldn't say that if you'd spent as much time with them as I have."

"Harry, you've only known them for two days," Hermione pointed out.

"Yeah, that was kind of my point…"

+

"What a moron! What kind of pureblood can't even ride broom? That's pathetic," Draco snickered, walking up to Harry and Hermione. "You sure know how to pick your friends, Potter. A moron and a mudblood."

"Neville is not a moron! Why don't you just shut up… uh…" Hermione glance to the side. Harry shrugged at her questioning look. "Uh… you…?" she finished lamely.

"You must be joking! How could you not know how I am!" Draco demanded. "What kind of idiots are you!?"

Harry smacked his fist into his palm. "Makeup!" he blurted out.

"Oh! The tart!' Hermione exclaimed in recognition.

"What!? You filthy mudblood, how dare you call me that!? I'm-"

"Mousie!" Angel happily exclaimed.

"-mousie!" Draco finished. "What? No! I mean, I'm heir to the house Malfoy, one of the most ancient and noble pureblood lines! One of the most powerful houses in the wizarding world! We're richer and better connected than almost anyone else! I'm Draco Malfoy! How could you not know that!?"

Harry stared at him, a blank look on his face. "Uh, okay. That's nice… I guess…"

"Don't be mean, My Boy. Mousie just wants to play," Angel announced, grinning and leaning forward. "Don't you, mousie?"

Draco reflexively took a step backward before he caught himself.

"Ha. You think you can intimidate me? You can't even touch me. But if you want to play a game, that's just fine with me," Draco smirked, holding up Neville's Remembrall. "Why don't we play with this?"

Harry glared at him. "Hey, that's Neville's! Give that back… uh…"

"Draco!" Draco snapped. "I just said that. How could you possibly have forgotten?"

"Sorry, I kind of zoned out when you started talking," Harry admitted.

Draco looked at hmi with wide, unbelieving eyes.

"What? It was really boring!" blurted Harry, looking to Hermione for confirmation.

The girl looked up from where she was cooing to Headwig, rubbing the bird against her cheek and tickling her head. "What? What was boring?"

"Wha… how could you… I was talking!" Draco whined.

Hermione sighed. "Harry, you should really listen when people are talking to you. It's very rude to just ignore Drico like that," she chided.

"Are you kidding? You didn't even notice Drico opened his mouth!" Harry accused.

"I did too," Hermione announce primly. "I heard every word Drico said."

"Draco!" the affronted boy screamed.

Hermione shrugged. "Sure. That too," she said dismissively. "You know, I think you might have some sort of hostility complex. You might want to look into that."

"How dare you! You're just a filthy mudblood! You think you can mock me like that and get away with it!?" Draco shouted.

Hermione stared at him for a second, then sidled up to Harry and nudged him in the ribs. "Harry, he calls me a 'mudblood' every time he talks. What's a mudblood?" she asked in a loud whisper, genuinely confused.

"How the heck would I know? Maybe we should ask Neville," Harry whispered back. "I mean, I think it's a wizard thing. An insult? It might be an insult. I think he's using it like one."

"What, really? That's not a very good insult. I mean, it kind of sounds like a bad thing, but it… lacks impact."

"Are you trying to make me look like fool you… you…" Draco stuttered.

Hermione helpfully finished, "Mudblood?"

"I-"

"Honestly, if you're going to insult someone, put some some effort into it," Hermione scolded. "If you can't do that, stop wasting my air, you pathetic waste of skin. You're such a disgusting affront to humanity that I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. If I saw you bleeding to death in a ditch, I'd sit down and watch. I could say you're a perfect example of why cousins shouldn't marry, but I'm pretty sure it was more of a brother-sister sort of thing. Every time I look at you I throw up in my mouth a little and thank god, because the best thing I get out of seeing your face."

The assembled student stared at Hermione in shock.

"What?" she said defensively. "My dad was in the navy."

"I- I- I have your ball!" Draco shrilled, holding up the Remembrall.

Hermione snorted. "Good for you. You're up to one."

"Holy shit," Harry muttered without thinking.

Hermione turned to glare at him. "Harry! You shouldn't talk like that!"'

+

Angel ignored him, circling him and inhaling deeply. After several circuits, she suddenly broke off and wandered through the crowed. She finally stopped in front of Pansy and leaned forward, causing the girl to make a startled noise and step back. Angel matched her movement, stepping in close and inhaling a deep breath through her nose.

"Oh. Okay," she said with a puzzled look on her face. "But that's kind of weird, because you smell like her in places you probably shouldn't..." Angel muttered, pointing a Pasny.

Once again, the entire group of students fixed their unbelieving eyes on Draco.

"Draco… Did you take my…?" Pansy asked in a horrified whisper.

"No! Look!" Draco shrilled. He rapidly shucked his clothing, stripping down to his underwear in front of the entire class. Gesturing down at his boxers with the Remembrall he still held, he yelled, "See!?"

It was only a moment later he realized what he'd just done. Seeing the eyes of well over two dozen students on him, he giggled nervously and backed a little distance away. He held the Remembrall out in front of him, as if the small torture device could hide his shame.

"Pink, Draco?" Daphne asked again. Her comment was met with several giggles.

Harry stared at the blond, then turned to Hermione and whispered, "Why does he still have the ball?"

"Having it is probably the only thing that makes him feel a little in control of the situation," she whispered back. "Either that, or he's reluctant to give up the only ball he has."

Angel glanced down at the ground, up at Draco and back down at the ground. Turning, she gave her master a bright smile. Pointing skyward she asked, "My Boy, what direction is that?" in a sweet, innocent voice.

The boy gave her a confused look. "Uh, up?"

Harry's broom, still laying on the ground where he'd dropped it when Neville fell, shot upwards. Normally this wouldn't have been worth noting at all. After all, that's what brooms did. In this case, however, Draco just happened to be standing above it, one foot on either side.

Draco's eyes bulged as the bristled vehicle slammed into a very tender part of his anatomy. He squealed like a stuck pig and grabbed the broom in an attempt to shove it away. Unfortunately, his newfound friend decided that this meant he was ready to fly. It rocketed into the air, dragging the unfortunate first-year with it.

As it turned out, people who are shocked out of their minds and in agonizing pain don't make the best flyers. The broom swerved back and forth violently, looking for all the world like it was trying to deliberately buck the boy off. With each sudden movement, the wooden shaft was ground harder against his… body.

Given that his current pained state and the fact that he still held the stolen Remembrall in one hand, it was only a matter of time before it happened. The broom took a sharp turn downward, launching Draco off. Luckily or unluckily, depending on how you looked at it, it immediately jerked back up. The tip of the shaft caught the waistband of his boxers, yanking him back upwards. There was another squeal as the front of his underwear was crushed against his abused bits.

Without thinking, Harry rushed over to the nearest broom and screamed, "Up!"

Draco's broom jerked back and forth in crazed patterns, swinging the wailing boy in every direction. The whole time he held the Remembrall clutched to his chest, as if it would somehow save him from his plight. After what seemed like a very long time, Draco was finally swung off the broom.

More accurately, a sharp up-down swerve popped him straight out of his boxers.

He experienced a moment of relief as he arced upward, pure joy filling him as the prolonged abuse finally ended. That joy was quickly replaced with terror as he hit the top of his arc, his body turning to face the ground far, far below. Screaming, he finally released Neville's gift.

Draco's fight-or-flight response kicked in with a vengeance. Unfortunately for him, there wasn't anything to fight and humans generally only fly down. He was left with no choice but to scream helplessly as he plummeted towards his doom.

A shadow fell over him. Looking up he saw - much to his surprise - Harry bearing down on him. The other boy held his broom in a white-knuckled grip, a look of extreme concentration on his face as he shot straight downward at top speed. Draco desperately reached out towards Harry as the Gryffindor released the broom with one hand..

Harry's hand shot out and grabbed the Remembrall that was falling next to Draco. The boy-who-lived pulled up hard, just barely halting his descent in time. Draco was left to slam into the surface of Black Lake like a sack of bricks.

Hermione fixed Harry with a shocked stare as he landed next to her. "You saved the Remembrall? Harry… that was cold," she muttered in an awed tone, examining the small stone held in his hands. "I mean, good catch and all, but… wow."

Harry stared down at the Remembrall with a stunned look on his face. Looking up at Hermione with wide eyes he protested, "I- I meant to grab him! It was an accident!"

"It was an accident?" she echoed. Looking up at Crabbe and Goyle, who were already flying towards the lake, she skeptically asked, "You accidentally grabbed a six-inch ball instead of a ten-foot person that was actively reaching for your hand?"

"Uh, yes?"

Hermione nodded. "Okay, that's the story then. I saw it happen. You were definitely trying to save Drico. You just couldn't grab him in time. That's definitely how I saw it."

"Yup. That's what I saw," Angel agreed. "He just took off all on his own. Right into the sky, shaft in one hand and ball in the other."

"Now hurry up and hide that thing while everyone's still looking at the lake,' Hermione ordered. "The stupid rock would be hard to see if you didn't already know he had it, and I doubt anyone else saw it."

"No, that's really what happened! Honest!" Harry insisted.

"Wow, Harry. I think… maybe your subconscious is a really, really scary thing," Hermione decided. "Angel, can you do something about the evidence?"

"Yup! I know how to handle balls!" she declared. She snatched the Remembrall out of her master's hand and stuffed it into her top.

Harry stared at her curiously. It appeared that she had acquired new clothing at some point. Strips of black cloth wound around her upper chest and hips, forming an improvised skirt and top.

"Angel, where did you get those?" he inquired.

"...I found them," the familiar responded.

Hermione immediately added, "They fell off the back of a truck."

Harry gave them an accusing look, then scanned the area. "Where are Drico's robes, Angel?" he asked suspiciously.

"Silly My Boy, Drico was all naked and stuff. He didn't have robes."

"Yeah, kind of weird to be walking around without robes like that," Hermione agreed.

"Well, he is silly enough to go around insulting people. Maybe he lost them?"

Hermione nodded. "Yeah. A person that walks around saying stupid things is definitely the kind of person who loses their robes."

"Mysteriously," Angel declared in a serious tone.

"Mysteriously," Hermione concurred.

"Uh, right… What's that, then?" he demanded, pointing at a small pouch made of she same cloth hanging from her waist. It was shaking and bouncing, angry noises escaping it every now and then.

"Um…" Angel looked helplessly at Hermione.

The witch shrugged. "I've got nothing."

"Angel..."

"She was annoying me…" the redhead whined.

Harry sighed. It was starting to look like it would be a very long year.

Still way better than the Dursley's, though

+

A loud voice, very familiar but distorted enough to be unrecognizable, roared, "Damn it, First Mate Shaved Scrotum! I said Hufflepuff! Hufflepuff, damn you! Can't you tell the difference between a 'Puff and a poof!?"

+

"Load gra~pe shot~!" Scrotum yelled.

The small figures raised their arms, prompting massive blobs of purple goo to appear. The blobs quickly vanished down the cannons' barrels.

"Ta~ke a~im!"

Snape paled as eleven canons locked onto the staff table, centered on him.

"You wouldn't dare…"

"Minerva, please deal with this," Dumbledore sighed. He waited a moment, then frowned when no response came. Turning, he stared at the empty seat next to him in confusion. "Minerva?"

Long Schlong grinned. "Never challenge a pirate, ye filthy landlubber. Scrotum, silence the foul wretch."

"Aye captain! Fire!"

The first volley devastated the staff table as all eleven canons unloaded blobs of high-velocity grape jam. It was hard to say whether it was from sheer shock or simple inability to evade, but the entire staff was sent reeling by the sudden assault. From there the cannons fired in sequence, one or two firing

in turn while the artillery crew reloaded the rest.

Captain Long Schlong Silver stood atop the center cannon the entire time, laughing like a madman as he rearmed the cannons. Scrotum remained crouched by his side with a look of extreme concentration on his face. Occasionally he'd twitch his fingers or grit his teeth as a cannon made a particularly sudden movement. Every now and then Long Schlong would call a shot, prompting his first mate to bring around one, two or even three cannons on the unfortunate professor who'd started to raise their wand. Because of this, their assault went on completely uninterrupted.

It seemed even the 'greatest wizard in England' had a hard time casting while being pelted with five-kilogram blobs of jam.

Go figure.

McGonagall, seated at the end of her house's tables, watched the devastation her students unleashed with a faintly amused smile on her face. To be honest, she was fairly impressed. Considering their level of education, the transfiguration and spellwork that went into the cannons was laudable. George - Sorry, Long Schlong - was replacing the Acceleration Charms as fast as the elves could ram ammo down the barrels. Scrotum, for his part, was showing a truly remarkable ability to control all eleven guns at once. This went doubly so considering how adept he was at cornering, cutting off and staggering the assaulted staff. Any attempt at retaliation was ended almost as soon as Long Schlong called out a target.

It had taken his son all of two months to further than James would have ever dared to go. Minerva wasn't sure whether her old student would be proud or jealous.

She was slightly amused to note that it took thirteen minutes for the pirates to exhaust every bit of jelly, jam, marmalade, gelatin, whipped cream, whipped butter, syrup, meringue, pudding in the castle, along with a single, very large coconut. She was very amused to note that that last one had probably brought an end to the Snape line.

She'd have to find a way to subtly reward them for that.

With a scream of, "And let that be a lesson to ya, ye filthy landlubbers!" the pirates and cannons hastily dropped down and vanished from the windows.

McGonagall let out a giggle that was quite unsuited to her age. Looking down at the note she'd found in her seat, she smile again and muttered, "Smart boys…"

This is a really bad place to sit.

+

"Well, now that you've been fed and properly clothed, we'd best get you back to Hogwarts. While I have my rights, there's little doubt the old bastard can make life difficult."

Harry giggled. "Oh, that's okay. I think he's probably pretty busy right now."

"Just hearing that would have been enough to make my day. Still, as soon as we find-"

At exactly that moment, the door to the sitting room burst open. Somehow Harry wasn't the least be surprised to see his familiar on the other side, lowering her extended foot. He was a bit shocked to see her wearing a white sundress of some sort. The cut and fabric were a bit odd, but it was definitely the closest thing to normal clothing he'd seen her wear.

"There you are, My Boy! I've been looking all over and over for you!" she declared happily. "This place is too~ big! Calli was helpin' me look, but she gets lots of distractions way too easy."

Vasia sighed. "That she does. I take it she's been with you, then? I was wondering where she'd gone…"

"Yup! She- Oops. One sec!" she said. Darting back into the hall, she quickly returned hauling something like a large, white sack behind her. The sack was quite obviously moving, and muffled swears and grunt could be heard from with. "See! I took good care of the pretty spider.

"You tied my familiar up with her own webs," Vasia blandly observed.

"Uh-huh! Oh, watch this! It's neat! Hup!" Angel grunted with effort and swung the cocoon around. Giggling, she twisted and hurled it straight up. The white prison slammed into the ceiling, producing a startled squawk, and hung plastered against the wood. "Calli sticks to the roofs!"

"Callidora is an Arachne. She normally sticks to roofs," Vasia said with no small amount of amusement in her voice.

Harry groaned. "Angel, let her out."

"Fi~ne," Angel sighed. There was a click as her claws snapped back into their proper position.

"Wait! Let her-"

Shreds of slashed webbing filled the air. There was another startled shriek as Calli plunged to the ground. From the sound of her impact, it wasn't a pleasant experience.
"Calli's not a very good spider. She didn't land on her feet!" Angel observed.

"That's cats!" Calli snapped, using the table to steady herself as she climbed to her feet. "Cats land on their feet. You land on your feet, not me."

Angel gave her a confused look. "But Calli has more feet than me. You should be better."

Callidora raised her hand to point at Angel, then paused. With a thoughtful look on her face, "You know, you're right. Weird…"

"Isn't it?"

Harry had to resist the urge to bury his face in his hands. "Angel, what've I told you about tying someone up with their own vicious bodily excretions?"

+

"So, are we preventing whatever is about to happen? I'd like to know how quickly I should eat this."

McGonagall shook her head. "I think not. I see no rules that have been broken, and I doubt the culprit would endanger their peers. Not too badly, anyway."

"Mff. Sho you know whooh it ish?" Flitwick asked through a mouthful of orangeish matter.

"Swallow, Filius. I do have strong suspicions as to the identity of the perpetrator, but nothing concrete enough to punish them."

There was an amused look on Flitwick's face as he examined her. "So it's like that, is it?"

"It is indeed."

"Well, I'm certainly not about to do anything. Wouldn't want my classroom to start 'mysteriously' burning down."

The comment earned him a smile. "You should have been a Breaker, Filius. You're far too good for the dueling circuit," McGonagall declared. "I thought it was a bit odd that you began teaching your first-year students about detection charms right before the mysterious culprits evaded several of said charms and burned down the fourth classroom."

"A wise man knows when it is better to let others do the work for him. 'Always' is generally the answer to that. And I'm afraid I don't have the stomach for your line of work."

+

"So are you guys done acting like yaoi-fodder, or what?" Hermione asked.

"Hey, that was a perfectly normal manly hug," Fred sniffed disdainfully.

"Yeah, except for the part where you grabbed my ass."

Fred wilted under Hermione and King's disgusted look. "Hey, I was trying to pick your pocket. Harry makes it look so easy!"</pre>

<pre>An instant later, the flames cleared, and as Harry had hoped, they were now in the middle of the Infirmary, much to the surprise of those present who were not petrified: Madam Pomfrey, James Potter, Rufus Scrimgeour, and the majority of the Weasley family who were all crowded around George's bed.

"Jim! Harry!" James exclaimed. He rushed forward to embrace both boys. Jim hugged his father back, while Harry was a bit more perfunctory, but neither rejected their father despite his recent shortcomings. Most of the Weasleys crowded around Ginny first and then Ron after Arthur carefully levitated the unconscious boy into a bed next to George's.

"So I take it reopening the investigation into Myrtle's death worked?" Harry asked. James grimaced uncomfortably, but it was Scrimgeour who spoke.

"Your suggestion was ingenious, Mr. Potter, but your father would not have been able to process the paperwork to reopen the investigation before tomorrow morning. Fortunately, someone else was on hand to provide a faster and equally ingenious way to circumvent the school's wards."

"Who?" asked Jim curiously.

"Lucius Malfoy! When the Minister advised him of the situation, Lucius exercised his authority as Chairman of the Board of Governors to arrange an 'impromptu careers fair' tonight at the school, and he invited a cross section of Ministry personnel here ostensibly to speak on the topic of job opportunities within our government. Among them are a dozen aurors and three Unspeakables who are taking the opportunity to restore order and begin an investigation while Ludo Bagman regales the students in the Great Hall with stories of his Quidditch days. That should kill another hour or so, after which various other functionaries will speak about what their departments do. In the meantime, the aurors are prepping for a complete evacuation of the school and an elite squad of hit wizards are getting ready to descend into the Chamber of Secrets. Of course, that expedition is obviously rendered moot by your own sudden arrival. So, as impressive as your appearance is, Mr. Potter, and as moving as these family reunions are, will someone please explain what's been going on?"</pre>

<pre>To say the team was surprised he was able to run was an understatement, given that he was small for his age and not very well filled out. In fact he was more used to these exercises because of non-magical schooling than anything else, aside from avoiding Dudley and his friends. Tossing a quaffle around on foot to practice hand-eye coordination and doing the rest of the exercises Oliver subjected them to was beneficial to them all. Harry figured that in a month's time the girls might actually appreciate it because it enhanced their figure. He had heard older boys and girls mention it when he was younger and he definitely understood it now. Still, he kept forgetting that wizards and witches loved to do anything with the least amount of physical strain possible.

"You're not human," said George from his right.

"Nope, definitely not," Fred agreed on his left.

"Giant?"

"Too small. Goblin?"

"Too tall. Centaur?"

"Not enough legs."

"Are you sure? Have you checked his pants?"

"There will be no checking of anyone's pants!" Harry blurted suddenly as he tried to keep from laughing at his own embarrassment.

"I wouldn't mind checking Harry's pants," Katie chimed.

The sound of necks cracking as they turned to stare at her cut through the air like thunder until Harry stumbled and rolled away from them. So startled and flushed by the comment he sat there on the ground gaping at the blushing girl as everyone paused to make sure he was okay. Oliver seemed caught up in his own astonishment while Angelina and Alicia looked as if they had just struck gossip gold. The twins, of course, wouldn't let Harry or Katie live this down.

"Did we hear that right Fred?"

"I believe we did George."

"Our own little Katie-"

"Has her own thing for-

"Ickle Harrikins!" The twins finished together.

While the twins burst out laughing, Katie flushed and tried to hide her face as Harry sat there equally as red. Oliver, Angelina and Alicia soon joined the twins in laughing when they saw Harry's astonished, blushing face. Harry, however, swallowed down any fear and stood back up. He had to admit that Katie was a good friend, they were the youngest of the quidditch team and had started the same year; it was natural for them to bond. That Katie was a trim and athletically built blonde bombshell didn't hurt either but despite his attraction to her, he wasn't entirely interested in that sort of relationship with his female quidditch playing friend. If there was ever a time to save everyone a bit of pain, now was it. Might as well make light while the making was good, right?

"Well I do like blondes, but redheads are better," Harry said loud enough to reach everyone's ears. "Especially if they're twins."

Instantly the twin's laughter died and the rest of the team fell on the ground laughing. Katie, whose blush had faded somewhat, also laughed, but sent him a thankful nod for taking attention off of her. He shrugged it aside and grinned, glad to have silenced the pair gifted so deeply with the gab before the pranksters caught on.

"We like you, Harry-" George started as he approached the younger teen

"But we don't like you, like you," Fred continued as he followed his brother's lead.

"I'm sorry, I know this is hard to hear," George said as he put a consoling hand on Harry's shoulder.

"But it's for the best, mate, you know?" Fred added as he set his hand in the other shoulder.

"We'd make Ron jealous-"

"And Percy,"

"Even Bill,"

"But we can't be a wizard's wizards for you."

"Though mum would appreciate it."

"We're flattered! But we don't swish our wands that way, Harry," they finished together with solemn expressions.

By now the laughter was deafening. Harry even joined in with some of his own and wiped a tear from his eye, playing up the act with an exaggerated sniff. "Well, I guess it's not to be, lads. It was a hell of a dream, we could have had a lot together." Harry sighed and took a deep breath while he still could as the team basked in the glow of humor. "I suppose I'll just have to settle for the Carrow Twins... I wonder if they'll share?"

"In your dreams, Potter."

Harry spun around only to see the aforementioned twins standing there with Tracey, Daphne and Lilly, all of them with mile wide smirks on their faces. Instantly the laughter behind him turned into snickers as the twins tried to hold it in and the team looked on as the teen stared down the group of third year Slytherin girls. Amusement played across the girls' faces and Harry paled at the thought of what they might do to him.

I'm a dead man, Harry thought. "Bollocks."

"There's your first problem, language," Hestia said as she crossed her arms over her chest.

"Second would be the wardrobe," Flora agreed. "But most of all-"

"We don't share," they finished together.

Harry flushed and swallowed once again, two attempts passed him by to the growing snickers of those around him before he managed to clear his throat and speak. "I... guess I'll have to live with that. The pursuit of beautiful women continues then."

"Or men," Daphne pointed out as the twins finally broke out laughing. "I didn't know you swung that way, Potter."

"And here I was hoping he was just dying to get a look at our bits," Tracey added with a mischievous grin of her own. "What's a girl to do?"

"Ask?" Harry's voice slipped out before he caught himself. He clapped a hand over his mouth as Oliver howled with laughter along with the twins. Devious grins swept across the Slytherins' faces once more as they approached and each of them eyed him like a predator. The sultry sway of every step tempted him to look below eye level and Harry was man enough to admit to himself that he did not mind looking down on occasion.

"Really? Good to know," Daphne said as she walked around him, her hand grazing the small of his back to tease him before she sauntered back to the group. Harry tensed at the touch, for more reason than one, before he forced himself to relax and observe the young women currently teasing and tempting him.

"Very good to know," Tracey agreed as she stepped toward him, away from the congregated group of slytherin girls. "But the question is, what bits does he want to see most?" At that the blonde turned just enough to give Harry a profile of her and arched her back. The alluring landscape of her body, hidden beneath the comfortable clothes of a free Saturday, caught Harry off guard and he couldn't stop himself from looking until it was too late. Tracey's smirk widened as she watched him eat up the view, noting that his eyes had started at her chest, then drifted down with her hands as she put herself on display in an attempt to tease and learn more of him.

"Well?" Tracey persisted with a smirk. "What do you think, Golden Boy?"

"I think I made a mistake picking Gryffindor?" Harry choked out as he watched all of the girls gather again.

"You did, too bad for you," the Carrows said together.

"Such a shame," the quiet Lilly agreed.

"But that's not why we're here," Daphne said as she got everyone back on track. "We know you have detention later and would like your help with some essays."

"Oi! What's this about detention, Harry?" Oliver asked as he caught on.

Harry winced and looked to his captain sheepishly. "McGonagall gave me detention with her until the end of term on Saturdays. She wasn't impressed with some of the language I used when she was convincing me to rejoin the team."

"That's all? Some foul language gets you a detention a week for the rest of term? I honestly don't think there's anything bad enough you could say to manage that. What the hell could you have said to get that?" Angelina questioned him as she finished stretching.

"It is bad enough when you suggest she might be in need of a tomcat to scratch the itch that makes her so stern all the time," Harry answered cautiously. He and Minerva had discussed this and this was the best option Harry could come up with. He wasn't a prankster but he could mouth off to Snape. Who's to say he couldn't mouth off to his own head of house for once? Everyone looked agape at him but the twins seemed impressed.

"I'm so proud!" Fred said as he pulled Harry into a hug. "He'll be a troublemaker yet, George!"

"Brave, brave lad! We'll need to test your nerves later!" George laughed as he pat Harry on the back.

"You actually said that to McGonagall?" Tracey looked in awe of him at that moment and Daphne actually began to snigger as he nodded.

"Please don't remind her!" Harry pleaded in an effort to convince them of his sincerity. "Merlin only knows what I'll have to do or how many more detentions I'll get if she hears word got out about that. I'll help you with homework today, just keep it quiet."

Harry was rather proud of his acting display. As soon as everyone calmed down and agreed to keep his off-color comment, imagined as it was, to themselves, the Slytherins went back up to the castle and the Gryffindor team hit the locker rooms. Training had been winding down anyway and now that they had had a good laugh at Harry's expense Oliver was willing to let them all go. Harry was thankful for the shower stalls in the locker room and quickly took one of his own to get rid of the sweat and grime in private before getting dressed without anyone seeing. As he said goodbye to everyone he managed to smile.</pre>

<pre>The thought of potions class made Harry grimace. Snape had been a bitter bastard the moment Harry had walked in with his sling. The potions' master had taken points off for not wearing his uniform properly because of the sling. Bill had been right, under two minutes in, actually it was more like thirty seconds if Harry was honest. The teen chuckled as he thought of taking the eldest Weasley son out to lunch next summer. He would have to send the curse breaker a letter as soon as he was finished with his early morning errand.

Harry had debated going to Professor McGonagall to get the points returned but had figured that would only make Snape worse. If the bastard wanted to be bitter then he could remain that way, Harry was trying to take the high road…

Though a bit of vengeance wasn't out of the question, as Fred and George had temptingly reminded Harry on more than one occasion.

Then again, seeing Malfoy flush red with anger and embarrassment every time someone rehearsed Hagrid's thorough reaming during Care of Magical creatures was actually worth it. Harry had actually heard it enough times to recite it by heart, though it had only taken once for Ron apparently. Even as Harry walked he couldn't help but whisper it to bring a smile to his own lips.

"What were ye thinking in that pureblood head of yers?!"

"I was thinking I'd actually learn something from this class but instead I nearly get killed!" Draco had barked at Hagrid. "Apparently you're not competent enough to be a professor if your students nearly get killed on the first lesson! When my father hears-"

"I don't ruddy care who yer father is! Ye nearly got yerself and Harry killed because of yer reckless and arrogant attitude!" Hagrid had roared. "What was the first blasted thing I told all of ye?! Eh?!" Malfoy remained quiet, flushed with indignant rage at being browbeat by a professor he thought substandard and beneath him. "I asked ye a question boy and I am yer professor whether ye like it or not! Now answer me!"

"You told us to follow your rules, you great oaf!"

"That's right! Apparently the great House of Malfoy never taught ye manners or how to take directions! Yer mother would be ashamed of ye and yer father will hear of this from me!"

"My father would never listen to you!"

"Yer father won't have a choice, boy! Yer actions spoke louder than words and I could have yer arse outta me class in an instant, and outta the school if ye pressed me! So go on, try telling me I don't know the rules or can't do that because 'yer father' says I can't. I bet ye me house that yer wrong." Malfoy looked as if he was about to pop before Hagrid continued. "The next time ye don't follow me instructions and get another student hurt, I'm dragging ye to the headmaster for reckless endangerment of yer fellow students! Ye get detention with filch for two weeks and thirty points for not thinking!"

Harry chuckled again as he finished his recitation. It was always good to see Draco put in his place, especially by someone with as big a heart as Hagrid. Lucius Malfoy had arrived the next day and tried his damnedest to get Hagrid fired, Buckbeak destroyed, and the punishment removed. He had been spectacularly unsuccessful. Draco hadn't actually been hurt because of his own actions, Harry. When Dumbledore had called him up to his office and asked Harry if he wanted anything done, Harry had asked for Hagrid to get a raise and requested ownership of Buckbeak.

Both had been granted, and not even Minister Fudge was able to argue the case since Harry, as the injured party, had gotten his form of justice, ownership of a Hippogriff that was loaned to Hogwarts for teaching. Dumbledore's eyes had twinkled madly with joy and victory at Harry's clever resolution, but the teen wizard had left the office as quickly as possible following that meeting. He had no desire to deal with the Headmaster or any other politicians.</pre>

<pre>Potions 101

Lord of Bones

Note: Ignores HBP and DH. And lots of brackets. Based on one of my contributions to the Weasley kill-off thread.

Ginevra Weasley seethed.

Not that this was new. After all, the youngest Weasley had a reputation for having a temper almost as legendary as Mt. Molly, but it was just a matter of time before people started wondering whether she would inherit Molly Mollywobbles Weasley’s physique as well.

Smart money was on who the hell wants to find out?!

Then again, her current pet peeve was actually somewhat warranted, at least in her mind.

Damn the weather! muttered the thin redhead angrily, carefully stirring the glowing topaz liquid in the cauldron with the barest hint of agitation in her movements.

A freak heat-wave had struck Britain during the later spring months, bringing the mild temperature to levels far more suitable for an Equatorial country like Malaysia than the northern reaches of Europe. Popular consensus blamed the Dark Lord Voldemort experimenting on weather magic (Somewhere in the Alps, Voldemort held back a sneeze before going back to his spellcasting. He was going to have a ski-ramp here, one way or the other!)

Apart from the usual consequences of a sudden spike in regional temperature (including Severus Snape being rushed to St. Mungos after a severe heat stroke and Draco Malfoy acquiring severe sunburn), there was another, somewhat unforeseen consequence.

Namely that most students were forced to shed their bulky outer robes for something less likely to act as a microwave, including tight white shirts and singlets.

This had inevitably resulted in some… interesting discoveries, at least for the male portion of the school.

And much to Ginny’s irritation.

The revelation that Hermione Granger — in addition to taking care of herself quite well — had a great rack had been rather… surprising. Even more annoying to Ginny was the amount of attention being spread elsewhere; namely to the interesting fact that Lavender Brown and Susan Bones were easily top contenders for Hogwarts’ Best Bust ‘97 (much to Ginny’s horror, Lavender and Susan’s endowments were all-natural and seemingly gravity-defying); that Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis and Pansy Parkinson had single-handedly overturned the Female Slytherins had the body of a diseased mole rat perception when they doffed their robes; that Ravenclaws were rather kinky with their bodily enhancements (Ginny was fairly sure that the nipple-rings were just the tip of the iceberg); and that Parvati and Padma Patil really were identical twins.

And, much to Ginny’s horror, the revelation that Harry James Potter preferred something more… substantial on his women.

And much to our dear heroine’s horror, the whole thing had resulted in a far less retiring and more… proactive Boy-Who-Lived.

Then, of course, came the incidents.

Goddammit! howled Ginny, accidentally letting her saliva into the cauldron’s mixture.

Oh yes, the incidents.

They were minor, at first. Hermione [Bookworm whore! howled Ginny in the depths of her mind] would be pointing out a few lines in a passage out (never mind that she’d be bending over and giving Harry an ‘accidental’ view of her cleavage), Lavender and Susan [Top-heavy bitches! snarled the ginger] pleading with Harry to give them a few Defence tips (all the while ‘coincidentally’ pillowing his arms against their breasts), Daphne Greengrass [Snake-slut! spat the obviously mentally-unhinged witch] bumping into the raven-haired wizard in the hallways (that she’d be pressing her ‘assets’ against the athletic wizard had nothing to with it)… 

It didn’t stop there, though.

Ginny began to grind her teeth as the memories rose up, then surpressed them through sheer force of will. At least Phlegm’s not involved in this she thought wryly.

(Elsewhere, a blonde Veela bombshell held back a sneeze before perusing outfits suitable for the seduction of a certain green-eyed wizard.)

Carefully, the redhead measured out the exact amount of her potion, confident that her newest concoction would tip the scales in her favor.

Pity she forgot about the drop of sweat she’d dropped on.

She tipped her head back and downed the potion. An ecstatic giggle left her throat as her chest began to expand from its barely-there state, growing and growing and growing… .

Slowly, revelation dawned on Ginevra’s face as she stared at her rapidly expanding chest.

Oh shi—

Elsewhere.

Harry looked down on the bevy of scantily-clad beauties lying on the bed. Daphne Greengrass lay on the far left, a sultry smirk on red lips while waves of black hair cascaded over her shoulders. A half-done green-and-silver tie and rested on her neck, while her artfully-positioned legs hid everything below her hips. Susan Bones was a far more demure sight, something which only enhanced her own curvaceous body and seductively modest pose.

Hermione was a surprise, though. The brunette was clad in a tastefully-ripped skirt, the hard points of her nipples straining against her white shirt. She gave him a shy smile, squeaking when she saw the obvious bulge straining against his jeans. Lavender, on the other hand, posed invitingly, playing with her own nipples and licking her lips welcomingly.

The Boy-Who-Lived smiled predatorially, resolving for a dose of House Unity before full-out Hogwarts Unity. He pounced.

In the midst of several feminine shrieks of surprise, moans and attempt to undress the virile young man who’d just landed in their midst, Lavender had two thoughts running through her mind.

Hope Parv, Pad and the ‘claws don’t mind that we started first, she mused.

And that Weather-Manipulation charm is the best damn spell ever.</pre>

<pre>Hadrian looked at Dumbledore warily while walking up to his father and grabbing his hand tightly. Neville also looked not very happy. Hadrian told him what the man did to him resulting in a deep dislike of Dumbledore.

"Dad, what is Dumby doing here? I don't like him…he is scary" he asked innocently.

Dumbledore made a chocking sound when he heard how the boy called him.

"My boy, it isn't very nice to mangle someone's name without his approval" Dumbledore scolded him.

Hadrian gave him a look that said he didn't care before he squinted and suddenly Dumbledore's hair and beard were a bright neon pink. Sirius snorted when he saw it and even Salazar smiled while Hadrian and Neville giggled.

"And here I thought that the flying lesson he gave you was indication enough to not scare him again. I also asked you to not do it again but it seems I fall on deaf ears with it" Salazar growled.

Dumbledore who needed to dissolve the tension and that quickly crouched down and gave him the best smile he could muster.

"Hadrian, I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you. Can you forgive me, my boy?" he said.

Hadrian didn't know what to do. On the one hand he didn't want to antagonize the man any further but on the other he knew very well that Dumbledore was the reason for him being left with the Dursleys. Despite that he hated how he talked to him. He was not his boy.

Salazar who felt the struggle in his son smiled at him in a reassuring way. Whatever Hadrian would do he would support him.

That was when an idea occurred to him. He poked Dumbledore on the chest just hard enough to destabilize him. Considering that the man was balancing on his toes it wasn't that hard. With a thud the old man fell flat on his butt. Quite a few people who walked by and saw that looked at him in shock and disbelieve while others smirked. It wasn't every day that a man like Dumbledore was brought down by a small boy.

"What did you do that for?" Dumbledore asked affected while getting up and straightening his robe.

"For calling me `my boy´, I don't like that Dumby" Hadrian pouted.

Knowing that when he continued the way he did the embarrassment would be even greater he retreated for now.</pre>

<pre>"Open the vault, goblin," ordered Lucius as he looked over his shoulder. The goblin walked forward opening the vault, as Lucius prepared to remove the Galleons inside. Narcissa could sink on her own as far as he was concerned, as was Draco who proved to be an absolute dismal failure of an heir thanks to Narcissa's coddling of him. He could find a new and much younger woman to continue the Malfoy family legacy.

The vault door swung open and Lucius's eyes widened. There was not even a single Knut in there. He looked to be poorer than a Weasley.

"Oh, and Malfoy, your wife was here just moments ago and she removed everything from your vault," responded a goblin who looked very amused. "And got a Portkey out of the country."

"Tell me where she went," said Lucius who wanted to kill Narcissa for daring to drain all the gold from their vault before he had a chance to do so. "Tell me you meddlesome filthy creatures."

"I don't think you will live long enough for us to answer," said a goblin smugly and before Lucius could even bother to ask what that meant, a Gringotts cart barreled towards him at full speed. Lucius turned and was smacked by the cart, being impaled instantly on it. The cart continued to move, before Lucius slipped off. The Malfoy heir hit the ground with a splatter, blood splashing the wall. The cart slowed to a stop, with a few of Malfoy's internal organs still stuck to it. Slowly, Downfall rose from the cart, to survey the body of Lucius which was ripped into pieces, with blood dripping from it.

"Another one meets their downfall, guess your escape act was all for nothing, Lucius," concluded Downfall as the goblins looked at Downfall, before they began to applaud. A couple of them had given the vigilante a salute. The fact that whoever was under the mask had slaughtered so many arrogant humans had made Downfall someone after their own hearts.

Downfall acknowledged their presence for the briefest of seconds before the vigilante was gone.

"Someone get a mop," said one of the goblins in an unconcerned voice as he looked at the grisly remains of Lucius Malfoy. "Oh and perhaps one of us should write Malfoy's brat to tell him his father is dead and his mother fled the country with the entire family fortune."</pre>

<pre>She opened the door with her left hand and aimed her wand at his face. "What did you say to me when we met for the first time?"

"Ah, Miss Granger! Welcome to my humble home!" he answered, tilting his head slightly. To his credit, he didn't even flinch and his grin didn't falter. Or maybe he didn't take her seriously, and was just humouring her. "And I said that you were not as serious as Harry had said."

Good enough, she decided and stepped aside. "Please enter, Mr Black."

"Thank you, Miss Merriweather," he said as he stepped inside.

Hermione froze for a moment, but recovered quickly. "I guess Mr Smith needs more students," she commented after closing the door. They had avoided him at the ball, but apparently, Mr Black had put two and two together.

"Ah… yes, he does." He nodded. "And not only because he obviously knows how to teach witches to present themselves to their best advantage," he added with a leer at her.

She glared at him, then pointed at the living room. "Please have a seat."

A few minutes later, he was sniffing at the glass of her dad's best whisky she had offered.

"It's not poisoned," she said. "Feel free to check."

He chuckled, but didn't follow her advice before taking a sip. "Ah… it tastes better than it smells," he said with an air entirely unsuited to a man dressed more like a biker than a rich gentleman. Apparently, her dad's best whisky wasn't good enough for the refined palate of the Head of the Black family.

"I wouldn't know. I've never tried it," she said.

"Ah… you need to try Ogden's Best."

"I prefer not to set my hair on fire while drinking," she retorted.

That made him laugh.

"So... what brings you to my family's humble home?" she asked once he had taken another sip from his glass. She had some suspicions.

"Well… I'm here to offer you my help." He smiled widely at her.

"Your help?" Hermione frowned. "You've already saved my family from ruin."

He dismissed that with a gesture, as if it hadn't been of any importance. "That was just gold. I want to help you with your 'education'." He leaned forward and folded his hands. "And your revenge, of course."

While she had no doubt that Mr Black would love to see those who had hurt her punished - Harry had told her his godfather's opinion of those old pureblood families - she also had no doubt that he wasn't here simply to offer his help. He wouldn't have had to meet her in private, without her tutor or parents present, otherwise. He probably wanted to use her for his own revenge. But she already owed him too much to turn him down anyway.

But she needed to know more. She shrugged. "You know that I'm far from being ready to take my revenge." Unfortunately, that was true. She was a good student, but Mr Fletcher had told her repeatedly that she wasn't yet ready for a real heist. Once she had learned to cast silently, though...

"I know. But Harry also told me that you're a genius. And Remus said you did very well, especially for a homeschooled student, from what he had seen in your exams."

She almost snarled at that comment. She wanted to excel without such a qualifier. "I'm flattered," she lied.

"Harry also told me that you're very competitive." His grin widened, and she frowned. She had thought she had worked on her tells.

But if that was how he wanted to play it… "What could you teach me that Mr Smith can't teach me?"

"It's not what I can teach you - I'm no thief, after all - but what I can offer you: Access to the Old Families and the Ministry." He crossed his legs and rested his hands on his knee. "I'm the Head of the Black family. We might not be the oldest pureblood family, although my dead mother would dispute that, but we're the richest. As my assistant or secretary, for example, you'd have access to the Wizengamot and the Ministry. In my company, you'd have access to circles your tutor never will have." He frowned. "Though you probably have to grow up first before we can try that. I don't need that particular reputation to darken my name."

She clenched her teeth for a moment - she was growing up! - and controlled herself. He was tactless, but he was right - what he was offering would help her immensely. Even her tutor would have to see that - Mr Fletcher was always telling her that a thief used every advantage they could get without violating their rules. And he knew as well as Hermione that she couldn't really refuse Mr Black. Not after all the wizard had done for her and her family. And even less now that he had revealed what he knew about her.

And yet… She smiled. "There is one thing you can teach me, though. One thing I really need to learn."

"Yes?" Mr Black managed to make the single word sound lurid.

"You can teach me how to escape Azkaban."</pre>

<pre>"There is just the matter of hiding the detection of these lessons from the rest of the school or to be more accurate, Dolores Umbridge," said Snape as he was about to give Potter an explanation of having Remedial Potions lessons, no doubt to take him down a peg.

"No problem, if anyone asks, I'm giving you Anger Management lessons, as one of the terms of revoking your probation," said Harry. "Anyone who's seen you on your worst day

"I do not need anger management lessons Potter!" snapped Snape angrily.

"Sure you don't," answered Harry. "I do have things to do, as I'm a very busy person these days, so the best I can spare is a couple of hours on Friday evening."

"Very well Potter," said Snape as he was in no mood to argue, but was very displeased that Potter was allowed to dictate the terms of something that he did not wish to do in the first place. Still his hands were very much tied on the matter. "We will begin on the first Friday after the term begins."</pre>

<pre>Things fell into something of a routine for the denizens of Hogwarts, albeit one that had certain random components. Students and staff alike sort of got used to the fact that every few days, a student turned up petrified. In a departure from his earlier position, Dumbledore suggested that if this continued into next year, he would investigate having a study done to evaluate what could be considered as options for assessing what might be valid actions for addressing the matter. Since accidents were down in Potions (most of which Snape credited to having made Neville Longbottom practice) and there were several upper years who were lying in a heap in a storage cupboard while awaiting Makdrake Draught—keeping the usual sources of the more dangerous incidents occupied—overall, it was a safer year than Hogwarts had seen in decades.

No one commented on the fact that there was a giant letter of dismissal hanging in the Entrance Hall, nor that no one from the Board of Governors had actually come by to make sure that Dumbledore had gone. Most people treated it as just another part of life in the castle and moved on to trying to do their homework and get persons of the gender of their interest into broom closets for some study of Anatomy (a course not offered at Hogwarts. Officially) and generally be students.

--

Dumbledore walked in and settled himself behind his desk. "I'm sure you are wondering why you are here. In fact, I would wager that you expect that I am about to tell you that two of your children are about to be expelled or at least face serious discipline matters"

"I don't like how that sounds," said Arthur.

"And you probably shouldn't. I'll start with the good news: the twins are not in trouble. Although I would request that next time that they decide to paint the Anatomy Tower as a giant penis, that they use materials harder to remove so I do not have to listen to upset House Elves about how easy it was to clean up."

"What?" Molly's voice hadn't risen, but her face had taken on a thunderous quality.

"I have to admit that their poems about female anatomy were quite lost on me, but I'm told they were quite erotic."

"What."

"And I was thoroughly impressed with their work on transposition so that when Aurora was walking up or down the stairs of the Anatomy tower, the castle's entire supply of rice pudding was heated to about ninety-eight degrees and then launched from the top in a geyser."

"WHAT?"

"So all in all, I have to say that they're doing quite well. And even then, I have to applaud them for having engaged in a prank war with Voldemort." He sighed as the two flinched and then flinched more as they registered what he said. "Or, rather, a shade of him possessing a student."

"Um . . . Headmaster . . ." began Arthur, uncertainly.

"Which rather brings me to the reason I called you here." Dumbledore rubbed his face for a moment. "For once, I find myself a bit at a loss. So I guess I'll just say it outright. Your daughter wrote in a cursed diary."

Molly paled and Arthur covered his face with his hands.

"Unfortunately, we didn't find out in time." Dumbledore ignored the beginnings of sobs. "Thankfully, one of our students was able to end the process before young Ginerva was completely annihilated." He paused. "But I'm not sure there's a good way to explain the rest. Tom!"

"Um . . . hi?" a familiar girl waved from her seat off to the side. The Weasleys had been so distracted they had missed her, having expected to see the twins and simply glossed over anything that didn't fit that.

"Ginny!" Molly dove at the girl and wrapped her in a deathhug.

"Not exactly," managed the girl as she was smothered.

"What?"

"Molly, if you would sit down?" Dumbledore looked very tired. "Thank you. Let me introduce you to Tom Marvolo Riddle. I should say that this is the new and rather improved version." The girl flushed a little and looked down sheepishly. "And now I will let . . . um . . . her explain."

"Uhh . . ." she looked around helplessly. "I'm Tom Marvolo Riddle. And a bit of Ginny Weasley. I have her memories and a bit of her personality, but when the transfer was stopped, there was more me in here than her." Molly's face was impressive in that it managed to be both scarlet with rage and alabaster pale in horror. "I'm pretty sure it can't be undone," Dumbledore nodded slowly. "I'm really sorry about this."

"Why did you do this?" asked Arthur.

"Well, I used to be a really bad person. Like budding dark lord bad." 'Ginny' scratched her cheek. "But somehow I got to see that I was on a bad path and want to stop." A pause. "It's a lot more complicated than that, but I really don't know how to explain having a major change of heart because someone stared at me."

"What?"

"Like I said, I don't get it either. But being angry seems like it was a lot of work." Another pause. "But judging from what I know of Ginny, I seem to have adopted her moral compass. Somehow it feels like a fitting middle ground."

Arthur blinked. He wobbled Molly, who was staring straight ahead, unmoving. "Umm . . . may I have a few minutes with my wife?"

"Just stay out of broom cupboards, Arthur; those are reserved for students and staff."

Arthur blinked and then towed his wife from the room.

--

"Girl-Tobi is coming along nicely, isn't she?"

"Much to my everlasting regret, yes," hissed Hermione.

"You're concerned she'll outshine you?"

"No. Just worried that it's unwise to teach her how to use magic at all, let alone like this." Behind them, there was a shriek of dismay as Ron found his food whizzing away from him faster than he could eat it. It appeared that Girl-Tobi was not even expecting to eat any of the food at this point, since she was no longer confining herself to sweets and was now stealing Ron's entire supply of goulash off of its egg-noodle bedding. It exploded as a ham smacked into it and sprayed nearly half the Gryffindors with meat and peas. "Just a feeling, mind you."

Someone had apparently had enough, since the rest of the red-garbed students began to fling more and more food at Fred and Fred, overwhelming the veteran beaters with projectiles ranging from dinner rolls to tureens of soup still in the tureen. The twins overturned the long table and used it as a shield from half the students as they dove to the side, leaving Girl-Tobi to drop to the ground out of the way of a wave of mashed potatoes and gravy. There was a squeaked sound of someone shouting 'but I didn't stay up late last night!'. There was also a faint weeping from McGonagall.

The Hufflepuffs began to dump food from their platters and use them as shields against the collateral comestibles. Then a stray turkey leg struck Hannah Abbott in the cheek and all hell broke loose. Most of the younger years took up dinner rolls and began to fling them at everyone not wearing yellow while the elder years scooped up piles of food and heaved them using the platters to launch a whole turkey at the Gryffindors.

Within seconds, the entire hall was coated in gravy and stuffing. The Slytherins weren't sure how they had gotten dragged into this mess. Hermione would have liked to blame Hari, but he'd avoided the whole thing. She suspected it was Crabbe and Goyle responding when Malfoy was struck by a ballistic boat of drippings and had replied with the contents of a dish of candied yams. Nevertheless, the result was the same. Alone in the chaos, Hari was sitting in an unsullied spot, eating his untouched food with that frustrating look that suggested that the busyness of the last few minutes had entirely escaped his notice.

Dumbledore, whose animated chicken had been joined by a few squires made from animated breadsticks, seemed unaware that his suit was now spattered with bits of corn from when Snape had fended off an incoming barrage of pies by throwing what had been on his plate at the time.

"And now that we've had that delightful diversion," he said as he used a piece of bread to swab gravy from his beard, "I do believe that it is time for us to clean up." He hummed to himself as Filch stomped out of the hall and returned, leading a trudging line of animated mops and buckets that followed him like eager puppies as he handed them out to students.

"Professor Headmaster, sir," began Hari. Dumbledore didn't jump, although Snape's face had gone pale at the sudden noise of a student he was beginning to believe was actually some sort of torment designed to drive him further insane. "Isn't this cruel to the House Elves?"

"I suppose." Dumbledore shrugged and proceeded to grab his animated chicken and struck it with a ham until it stopped flailing. "But it feels right somehow. Chicken?" he held out a leg to Snape.

"Albus?"

"Yes?"

"Did you just bludgeon an animated chicken?"

"I had to get it to stop moving, didn't I?"

--

"Alright. So, class, who can tell me what a boggart is?" Lupin pointed to a Ravenclaw who had raised a trembling hand. "Yes, Miss . . . Higgens?"

"It's a fear-monster, Professor Lupin. It shapes itself to our fears to try and scare us away."

"Not bad. Anyone else? How about you, Mister . . . Graves?"

"Um . . . they feed . . . er, . . . I don't know, Professor Lupin." The boy flinched.

"Dear, dear," said Snape from behind his magazine. "I thought I drilled it into you that a bunch of dunderheads need to read their textbooks." To the surprise of Professor Lupin, the boy didn't seem afraid of Snape. The last time Lupin had been able to get much information about what was going on at Hogwarts, which had been five years ago, admittedly, Professor Snape was the terror of the castle.

"Last year we were taught that reading the textbook is for pussies, Professor Snape," said a young Hufflepuff.

"I suspect that only applies to non-dunderheads, Miss Wieks. In the future, do the rest of us a favor and read the book until you are able to see competence with a telescope." Snape turned a page and drew a ballpoint pen, circling something and grumbling about idiots being allowed to publish.

"Well then . . ." said Lupin weakly—what was going on here? "Does anyone know how a witch or wizard fights a boggart?"

"Cut off its head?"

"Burn it alive? And dead?"

"Sacrifice a weaker classmate?"

"The Four Ds?"

Despite his growing concern, Lupin had to ask. "Do you mean the Three Ds?"

"No, Professor Lupin."

"What are the Four Ds?"

"Disembowel, dismember, decapitate, destroy."

"Oh." Lupin looked at Snape, who seemed unperturbed by this. "No. There is a simple incantation we use. By casting it, we force the boggart to turn from something terrifying into something funny. Laugher drives away a boggart."

"Does it kill it?" asked Wieks.

"No!"

"Then we should probably stick with the Four Ds."

"What in the name of . . . no. No. The spell is ridikulous."

"It sounds like it, anyway," murmured Snape. Lupin was horrified to see a few students nod.

"No! Everyone take out your wands and try casting the spell." Lupin tried not to pay much attention to the fact that Snape was probably smirking. It was also a bit unnerving how quickly the class formed up into lines and began to practice the spell over and over and even more unnerving how quickly they picked up the proper casting.

"See?" said Snape. "Now that you dunderheads are applying yourselves . . ." He turned another page. "Speaking of dunderheads . . . who let this idiot near a junior chemistry set?"

"I'm going to open the door now. Everyone have your wands ready." Lupin opened the door to the wardrobe.

A figure in a red and black cloak stepped out, single red eye gleaming. "Good morning, class." Every student dropped his or her wand. The pale boy gave a huge grin. "Today, we have a guest instructor." A shadowy, half-formed shape in an identical cloak began to emerge and the entire class screamed in terror, but remained frozen in place. Lupin was too shocked to act.

"Oh for heaven's sake . . ." Snape pointed his wand over the top of his magazine. "Ridikulous." The figure turned into Draco Malfoy cowering in a fetal ball while a stylized Hermione Granger menaced him with a copy of the collected works of Shakespeare. As the huddled blonde babbled for mercy, the class began to laugh with relief and the boggart fled back inside its wardrobe.

"Class dismissed," said Lupin and watched the students collect their wands and shuffle out. He glared at Snape. "What the hell was that about?"

"I do believe that their last Defense teacher made an impression."

"What?"

"That was him. It's unusual for a boggart faced with a group to find a shared fear."

--

"Alright, class, what is the most dangerous magical creature you know of?" Lupin asked. He'd decided to stop greeting his classes with 'good morning' or 'good afternoon' after both Second Year classes and his first group of Third Years all flinched.

"Hari Potter," replied the entire class. Except for one boy who said "My dad".

"Um . . ." Lupin had been prepared for a lot of answers, up to and including puffskins—which weren't dangerous at all, but that wouldn't stop at least one joker from saying it (here he was thinking of James Potter)—but he had no idea whom they were talking about. "What?"

--

"In addition, I made sure that the dementors are not anywhere near the castle. I cannot be certain, of course, but I do think that I have managed to deal with most of the more serious—why is that dog barking?—threats."

It was about that time that Professor Lupin, recovered from his loss of air, got annoyed at Professor Snape pointing and laughing, and, in a fit of childish pique, flung a leg of roast chicken at the man, who (having been in a school with Hari for two years) ducked promptly, allowing it to fly overhead and strike Professor McGonagall. As Lupin stared in open-mouth horror, Dumbledore smiled warmly and drew his wand. "Let us thank Professor Lupin for initiating the food fight." He jabbed his wand at the table and a trio of chickens donned little improvised suits of armor and began to form a phalanx with their cadre of breadstick-and-roll soldiers, some of whom began to hurl food randomly at the students below. He then sat back down and began to eat his meal as chaos erupted.

Draco Malfoy had been learning in the last two years. He had not gained much knowledge of magic, but he was learning to avoid Hermione Granger and any possibility she might throw things. It was because of that that when he saw that food was beginning to fly, he made a dash for the exit and hid in the Entrance Hall until the noise died down. It was quite interesting to listen to.

The Hufflepuffs quickly formed ranks, the youngest ducking under the table in fright as their peers began to grab dishes to hide behind and the upper years began to conjure shovels to hurl larger amounts of food with. The Seventh Years were working to defend their space with judicious use of banishing charms as taught by Professor Potter, sending airborne foodstuffs back at the originator with excessive force.

The Slytherins being Slytherins, the only people they trusted less than their own was everyone else, so they used the advantage of having a wall at their backs to focus their efforts (as best as a disorganized mob could manage). The ones who were able to think strategically (and most the remaining upper students were among them—stupidity having not been a survival trait in recent years) began to use shield charms and banishers to keep the largest of the attacks away. There were too many projectiles to stop them all, but at least the turkey that the Weasley Twins had lobbed was blocked.

Ravenclaw was trapped between rivals and the students were clearly wishing that they could go back to studying. Once they had stowed their books safely under the tables, they began to return attacks with the viciousness instilled by Professor Potter and fueled by annoyance at interruption of their peaceful reading. Their table was quickly cleared of food as they began a wholesale assault on the entire room, finding their arsenal quickly replenished and set about trying to get as much of the pumpkin pie aimed at Professor Lupin as they could manage.

Gryffindor was not left out, of course, but they were ably lead by the terrible trio: Fred, Gred, and Girl-Tobi. The former two had more breadth of skill and were transfiguring things to be thrown (although why they wanted to hurt dildo-shaped drumsticks was unclear) as well as screaming at the top of their lungs for the sons of bitches under their command to get back in their ranks and to hold fast. Percy of all people had conjured a peaked cap and was screaming in an Eastern European language while flinging spoonsful of peas at anyone of their house who appeared to be faltering.

At the head table, Professor Lupin was taking advantage of the opportunity to attack Black and, to the horror of the staff (aside from the Headmaster, who was calmly having pudding behind his defensive line), was flinging everything in arm's reach at the dog already covered in gravy and slices of ham. To the further horror of the staff, the dog had made a crude sort of catapult using plates and some long French loaves to hurl things back. And possibly worst of all, it was hard to tell who was winning (although the dog had help from Ravenclaw).

--

"And I would like to thank our guest instructor for graciously donating his time to help our students learn the best way to avoid being turned into a bloody paste. It is most unfortunate that three students didn't learn in time," said Dumbledore after dinner. "I am happy to say that we were planning to expand the Lake, so the impromptu demolitions performed as part of today's . . . unplanned activities . . . work out for the best, although we are having to see if we can find a new colony of Merpeople to move in. Again.

"On a related note, I am happy to report that the Forbidden Forest is much less forbidden . . . in that there is less of it to forbid. On the other hand, I am able to announce the new rules regarding the Forbidden Crater which students are expressly forbidden from entering until such time as it has been verified clear of all remaining explosives and landmines.

"I hope you all enjoyed your fish for dinner and will do so again for the foreseeable future." He turned to Deidara. "Please don't come back."

--

Fwoosh

"Gah!" Pansy shouted. She threw down her silverware. "Damn it, Potter! You couldn't have waited until dinner was over?"

"Potter?" snapped her father.

"Father, if I might introduce Hari Potter?"

"You may not! I don't—"

Hari was suddenly in front of him and his wife, bowing slightly. "Greetings, Mister and Missus Pansy's Parents. I just wanted to accept your thanks."

"Our what?"

"For saving you from your horrible fate."

"Come again?"

"I read the transcripts. You were forced to do things against your will. I'm glad I was able to save you from your waking nightmare. I think that's what you said it was."

"What?"

"And your poor wife from her job torturing muggle children. You are most welcome."

Pansy was staring in horror at her friend, whom she was certain was about to be cursed into oblivion.

"I'm glad that I can be friends with your daughter and thereby teach her to avoid falling into the same trap that you did when you first met whatshisface? Voldi-dork? I can't remember."

Any moment. She was sure that it was any moment; her friend was going to be utterly erased.

"I hope you don't mind if I join you for an early supper."

"We most certainly—" began her mother.

"I'm glad." Hari snapped his fingers and a House Elf brought a chair for him to sit on. "Do you have any rice? Well, I'm sure your elves can find some."

"What?"

"Are you going to do that thing, too?"

"What?"

"You are. Okay." Hari turned. "How's your summer been, Pansy?"

"Uh . . . suddenly less sane. Do you really think our elves are going to get your rice?"

"Why not? I'm not an honored guest?"

"Well . . ."

"That's what I thought."

"You're bloody mad."

"I'm not angry at all!" Hari smiled. "I'm feeling quite beneficent." He apparently was unaware that there was a seething hatred coming from the other end of the table. "Please tell me you have something to drink other than pumpkin juice."

"Water?"

"Oh good."

There was a tense silence during dinner. Tense and silent on the part of Mister and Missus Parkinson, who were both trying to figure out how to murder the Boy-Who-Lived without getting in trouble, given that he was being transported by Dumbledore's phoenix. Pansy was engaged in relatively calm talk with her insane friend, discussing the upcoming year.

--

"Millie?"

"Yes, Hari?"

"Why are you in jail?"

"My mom said that I'd have more fun here than at home, so she didn't bother to bail me out. Besides, I figured you'd be by sooner or later to get me out if I needed it."

"Alright then."

"Besides, I slugged an auror and they took it badly."

"Why?"

"I was in Diagon Alley a week or so ago when the aurors started flinging spells. One of them nearly hit me and so I punched him in the face and then I was stunned and the next thing I remember was waking up in a cell."

"There's a thing."

"Yeah. I had a cell to myself. The Warden said something about having been a guard here a while back and remembering my mother." Millie grinned. "He told me that after her first time in jail, he never made her share a cell with anyone because there aren't House Elves and no one likes to clean the stuff off the walls."

"Makes sense."

"And my mum is so jealous of me, too."

Hari watched as a few witches and wizards who'd entered the room cautiously now went about carefully stunning the people on the ground and stacking them up to the side. "Why is that?"

"Thanks, m'Lady!" called over a somewhat portly man. "We'll add it to your tally!"

"Because I'm being paid by the number of riots I break up while here. Compared to my mum, these guys are a cakewalk. After I broke up a riot by accident, they offered to pay me. They have to keep moving me around the jail, though, because people don't want to riot after I break it up." Millicent pouted, which was a horrifying sight.

--

Snape turned to prowl along the aisles, checking people's work. "Mister Potter."

"Yes, Professor?" Hari didn't look up, and was carefully stirring the potion using his teeth to hold the spoon as he added beeswax soaked in milk (of a cow).

"What are you making?"

"If I add this horn? Bomb Balm."

"I did say to make a potion from last year."

"Sixth Years were making it last year."

"Of course."

"That was close," Hari said as he suddenly started stirring the opposite direction.

"What was close?"

"The potion would have exploded if I had continued to stir that way."

"I'm not even going to ask how you know that." Snape sighed. "But please refrain from making potions that are intended to explode in my classroom. In the future," he added. "If I vanish it now, I don't think any of us would be here to realize."

--

"Who can tell me the most remarkable thing about the effect of hippogriff dung on most species of plant used for potions that work on the mind?" Professor Sprout was trying to get her class of First Years to pay attention to the basic lessons that might prevent them from accidentally poisoning themselves later in their time in school. "You there. The Ravenclaw who's picking his nose instead of listening."

"What?"

"Perhaps you'd care to tell me what is so interesting?"

By way of answering, the boy pointed out the greenhouse wall. Professor Sprout was able to just make out a boy in a black cloak chasing what appeared to be a tree that was rustling in terror and fleeing on two legs instead of a collection of roots. The boy was waving what she was fairly certain was Hagrid's ax—and she suspected this because the half-giant in question was chasing after the boy and shouting something that sounded like 'thasmyax' and then a bunch of words she hoped her students weren't able to understand—and towing a huge, black dog along with his other hand, digging furrows in the grounds.

It took her a moment or two to realized that the tree was weaving its way towards Greenhouse One, where she was currently holding her class. As it approached, she could hear it babbling. "Pleasedontchopmedown!I'llneverdoitagain!HelpProfessorSprout!Helpme!" And similar things.

The boy seemed to be enjoying this, to judge from his smile. He also seemed to be playing with the tree, given that every now and again, he would somehow catch up for a moment, give the tree a glancing chop, and then fall behind again with theatrical displays of being winded while never being caught up by Hagrid.

"What's that, Professor?" asked the boy.

"That's just Professor Potter. He sometimes teaches Defense. Don't mind him."

"I know Professor Potter!" squeaked a Slytherin. "He killed my older brother!"

"I'm sorry about that, dear."

"He was stupid is what daddy says. It's better that I'm the heir."

"Oh." Sprout cleared her throat. "As I was saying earlier." She raised her voice to be heard over the greenish screams and the sounds of metal hitting wood repeatedly just outside the door.

She risked a glance outside as the sounds died down and saw Hari tucking the severed limbs of the tree into his cloak and dragging away the sap-leaking torso/trunk that looked like it was sobbing pitifully by its leaf-hair. She sighed and closed her eyes before returning to her teaching. And that was why she was completely unprepared for the voice behind her.

"It's taken care of, Professor Sprout."

When her heart had settled a little and her students had caught their breath after screaming, she turned. "Thank you," she said dryly.

"I replanted it. It'll grow back. Probably. I think it will, anyway. And he knows now not to start fights with other plants."

"I hope in general."

"Probably. But I told it if it annoyed you again, I'd use fire. So I think he'll listen next time."

--

"Why are you here?" asked Draco Malfoy in a petulant whine. By now, though, it had become clear that he wasn't really whining, but that he had been unfortunate enough to be cursed with a voice that always sounded like he was a brat.

"I'm teaching Defense this year during the week out of every month that Professor Lupin is busy being a werewolf." He swatted Sprinkles's muzzle as the dog growled at him and then attempted to rip his arm off, missing entirely.

"What?"

"It's quite simple: during the time around the full moon, Professor Lupin is a bit out of sorts and so I was asked to reprise my duties from last year." Hari paused. "It's funny, now that I think about it, but it lasts for a week and during it he's lethargic and in severe pain and sometimes a violent monster. Is being a werewolf like having a period?"

The girls in the class were suddenly wooden-faced. "What," Daphne kept her voice level.

"Just wondering on the nature of a magical disease."

"You know," mused Hermione, "they even discriminate against werewolves just like they do against women."

"Worse," commented Millie. "At least women can get employed and stuff."

"Why aren't any of you worried?" asked Malfoy, although he looked like he was more curious than concerned.

"Probably the same reason as you," replied Pansy, speaking to him for the first time in nearly two years. "Because when our other option is Hari, somehow a known werewolf just isn't all that scary."

"And now that we have that out of the way," said Hari, "I have some leftover spiders for you to use for practice."

"Joy," muttered Tracy.

--

"POTTER!"

"Yes, Professor Snape?" Hari asked of the man screaming from the high table.

"Would you care to explain why I have a pool of urine with Draco Malfoy sitting in it behind my chair?"

"I'm going to assume either you or he have a bladder control problem."

"An interesting diagnosis," snarled the man as the rest of the hall went utterly silent.

"Thank you."

"Perhaps you can offer another suggestion?"

"There's normally a chamber pot behind your seat?"</pre>

<pre>"That's just GREAT, Hermione. Now what's Harry supposed to play Quidditch on? Tell us that, you're so smart!"

Hermione's mouth was pinched very tightly shut and her head was lowered though her eyes stared up with conviction. Harry could just make out the hastily hidden beginnings of tears reluctantly forming around her eyes. "I had no other choice. It wasn't safe."

"Whaddaya mean it wasn't safe?" demanded Ron. "It was a brand new, never before used Firebolt, for Merlin's sake. And speaking of that, what do YOU know about brooms!"

"By not safe, I meant that I thought, and Professor McGonagall agrees, that Harry's new broom was sent by Sirius Black," she explained to Harry in a penitent tone.

Harry's eyes widened.

Hermione turned to the side to glare at Ron and said, "And as to brooms, I'll have you know that I researched everything I could about brooms, the Firebolt in particular, and I even wrote the company to ask additional questions." She poked Ron hard on the shoulder several times (and inwardly cringed at how filthy he was, she resolved to wash her hand several times once this was over). "Well? What do you have to say about that?" Far from the penitent and remorseful pose she'd struck when talking to Harry, now she seemed self-assured. Haughty almost…

Ron was scowling. "I know plenty about brooms! Charlie used to let me-" he started, but Hermione interrupted.

"Charlie? He's your brother isn't he? So, what you're saying is you don't actually own a broom, and if your grades are any indicator, then you couldn't research to save your life. Is that about the size of it?" She demanded.

Ron, face redder than even his hair, looked off to the side for a moment, his eyes motioned to Hermione and then the oddest thing happened. His mouth dropped open in disbelief. "It's NOT supposed to be like this." Ron bit out tersely.

"Tough." Hermione responded.

Clenching his fists in rage, Ron looked as if he was going to start screaming, but he saw Harry had positioned himself behind Hermione and the glare was scarily similar to how Harry had looked when Lockhart had betrayed them in the Chamber. "BE THAT WAY!" He declared for all the world to hear and then stormed off and out of view.

Harry looked genuinely confused. "What now?" He asked in an uncertain tone to Hermione.

"Are you mad at me, Harry?" Hermione asked, her timidity had returned in full force.

Harry ran a hand through his hair. "Well, no, not exactly. I mean, I would have preferred you actually asking first before doing what you did, but I guess I can understand the need. But…" and Harry trailed off.

"What? What? But what?" Hermione asked while clutching at his robes with both hands.

"Though I hate to admit it, Ron did have a point… besides the one on his head."

"Oh?" Hermione queried uncertainly. Ron actually having a point was a new proposition for her. "Explain."

"What am I going to ride?"

Eyebrows rising at the question, Hermione released his robes and slinked up to him. "If you want something to ride, then ride me." She said in a deeper, huskier tone than should have been possible for one so young. She then pressed her body into his.

Instinctively, Harry's arms went around her to draw her body closer.

Lips found lips and suddenly a loud voice filled the room. "CUT! CUT! That is SO not in the script!"

Harry and Hermione didn't seem to care.

The director, a man whose natural voice came in two flavors – loud and louder, screamed at his lead stars. "STOP IT YOU TWO! I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME! I GAVE YOU SOME LEEWAY FOR ARTISTIC PURPOSES BUT THIS ISN'T A LOVE SCENE! AND EVEN IF IT WERE, YOU TWO WOULDN'T BE THE ONES DOING THE KISSING!"

That stopped the young girl. "WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR WANTING TO KISS MY HUSBAND! IT'S NOT OUR FAULT THAT THE SCRIPT HAD BAD SOURCE MATERIAL!"

Much grumbling could be heard. "I AM NOT GETTING INTO ANOTHER ARGUMENT WITH YOU ABOUT PLOT HOLES AND INCONSISTENT CHARACTERISATION. IF I DID, THEN WE'D BE HERE ALL NIGHT. STOP ACTING LIKE YOUR 20 YEAR OLD SELVES AND START BEHAVING LIKE THE 13 YEAR OLD SELVES YOU'VE BEEN SPELLED TO APPEAR TO BE!"

"BUT-" Harry began.

"AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU ACTUALLY ACTED LIKE THAT WHEN YOU WERE 13. I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW THE SCRIPT. UNDERSTAND?"

"Yes, Director." They both simultaneously chorused. Stepping apart, the two straightened their appearances and went back to their marks.</pre>

<pre>"What would be your primary goal in teaching the children of Hogwarts?" one of the other members asked.

"How to stay alive," Harry stated simply, letting the words sink in before continuing. "One of the basics I'd like them to understand is how to find, or make, an exit."

"You want them to run away?" one of the members stated angrily.

"I want them to survive. Not everyone can be a hunter of dark wizards or dark creatures," Harry corrected succinctly. "And even those who are, on occasion, need to be able to get out of a situation where they're outnumbered, or when facing a superior enemy."

"What, you expect them to just be attacked in their homes or on the street?" It was an angry member of the board now. "Here on the isles, we are perfectly safe! There are no dark wizards running about trying to torment people and I won't stand for the idea of someone trying to drum it into people's heads!"

Whatever Harry was going to say was cut off in a violent explosion as the wards protecting the room were violently shredded and one of the walls exploded in a shower of debris.</pre>

<pre>"So." Harry looked at Charlus as they again sat across from each other in the muggle pub. "I find myself reluctantly forced to ask you two questions."

"Oh? That is a nice change of pace," Charlus noted as he sipped his scotch. "I do, however, reserve the right to give you a vague, cryptic response like you enjoy giving."

Harry grimaced a bit. "One, do you know of a way for me to get into Hogwarts? Voldemort has something hidden there that I need to retrieve."

Charlus pursed his lips and arched a brow. "Technically possible. And the second?"

"Know where I could find work?" Harry asked with a sigh. "I'm almost out of the funds I've managed to accumulate. And with the idiots behaving there hasn't been much in the way of income."

"What skills and references do you have?" Charlus asked neutrally as he studied Harry.

"Hunting and neutralizing Dark Wizards," Harry stated bluntly. "And… you and the Wilkinses. Oh, and probably Moody."

Feeling a slight bit of irritation as the lack of further information Charlus asked, "Surely you have more references than that."

"Well, you could ask Bellatrix… Black," Harry stated with a pondering look on his face. "Other than her, most of the others who might have testified as to my work are a bit… well, unavailable."

Charlus pondered the words, before suddenly smiling as he looked back at Harry.

Immediately Harry gave him a look. "No."

"You don't know what I was going to say."

"I'm trying to avoid Dumbledore. I'd rather not be stuck in the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts directly underneath him." Harry stated flatly.

For a moment Charlus stared at him before his mouth opened. "How the bloody hell did you know that I was going to suggest…?"

"Because I mentioned needing to get into Hogwarts and needing a job," Harry stated flatly and then sighed. "Ugh. I had truly hoped to not have to go through that. I suppose you don't know of anywhere to acquire basilisk venom?"

"The Defense against the Dark Arts class has only had trouble with maintaining staff for the last few years. The position isn't even publically known. How did you know there would be an opening?" Charlus demanded. "And what the bloody hell do you want that for!?"

"The item I need to retrieve is responsible for the jinx keeping the post empty after a year," Harry stated as he rubbed his temples. "I need basilisk venom to destroy it. Only other thing I know of that would work is Fiendfyre and I don't like that spell."

There was a sudden, horrified fascination on Charlus' features. "What manner of item could you possibly be talking about that would require such lengths to destroy?"

"A horucrux." Harry twisted his lips into a grimace of disgust. Seeing the look of incomprehension on Charlus' face, he continued. "One of the darkest magics. Splitting your soul in order to maintain your physical presence in this realm after death. You end up stuck in limbo if they're destroyed, and if you die… well, let's just say that you have to be either supremely desperate or supremely arrogant to make one."

"I… see." Charlus frowned slightly. "And you say that this Voldemort has made one?"

"Several," Harry responded with a grimace. "I only know where two of them are."

"Of which, one of them is at Hogwarts." Charlus stated as he stared back at Harry.

"Yup," Harry agreed with a nod of his head and a sigh of irritation. "So, basilisk venom?"

"Impossible," Charlus stated flatly. "It's illegal to even own a basilisk. In the rare cases when it does come on sale, it's always on the black market, and gone before anyone else even knows about it."

"I was really, really hoping you weren't going to say that," Harry stated with a groan. "Really, really hoping."

"Do you not have an alternative?" Charlus demanded.

"Alternative source," Harry stated softly as he rubbed his face. "But that requires going to Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets."

"… Are you sure you're right in the head?" Charlus asked as he looked at Harry critically.

"Unfortunately," Harry stated with a sigh and a wave of his hand. "It exists. Sadly, Riddle found it when he was a student at Hogwarts."

"The Hagrid incident," Charlus stated as horrifying pieces fell into place. "How can you possibly know all of this? This is…"

"Unfortunately, I've had to spend some time in Tom's head." Harry absently stated with a grimace. "Thankfully, when it was happening, he didn't know about it. And I am never willingly going to do it again."

"But, but…" Charlus struggled to try and wrap his mind around Harry's statement.

"He's a damned good Legimens, but not as good as an Occlumens." It was all Harry was willing to say on the topic.

"I… see." Charlus swallowed as he slowly stared at Harry. "And the Chamber of Secrets…"

"Holds Slytherin's basilisk," Harry stated simply. "The best thing would be to get a goblin-forged blade to stick in the venom, honestly."

"Taking on the property of the venom." Charlus finished for him as he sighed and slumped. "Thus, if you have to destroy more of them, you have something to do it with."

"Indeed," Harry agreed with a nod. "Plus, they make for nifty cursed dark object destroyers."

"Imagine that," Charlus stated dryly as he shook his head. "Commissioning the goblins to make such a weapon wouldn't be too terribly hard. However, it would cost. For which, you will need money."

"Hence, my search for gainful employment." Harry stated simply. "No offense but I'd prefer to have something like that falling into anyone else's hands. Basilisk venom is not a pleasant thing to experience."

"… You've been poisoned by basilisk venom?" Charlus stated incredulously.

"Well, yes and no," Harry admitted as he rolled up his sleeve to reveal a large and faded scar. "Got bit once. It's also how I learned about the wonderful properties of Goblin made blades. Killed the basilisk with it. It was an unpleasantly similar situation to this in fact."

"… Do I wish to know?" Charlus asked worriedly.

"It involves a dark wizard who spent most of my younger years trying to kill me, his horucrux and a lot of bloody luck on my part." Harry said with a grimace. "He was obsessed with me. Kept escaping and going into hiding too. Took me years to finally put him down permanently. It's why I know so much about those damned things."

"Then why are you here, now, without anything to your name then?" Charlus demanded as he looked back at him. "Where is your goblin forged blade imbued with basilisk venom? Where are your resources, where is anything of yours?"

"Gone," Harry stated quietly as he stared out into the distance. "They're all gone. Everyone I knew, everything I had. Wiped out. As if they were never there. After it was over… Well. I had nowhere else to go. So, I ended up in merry ole England. And after a number of cascading events, here I am."

"There would be record of something like that happening. It would be all over the press." Charlus said. "Even if it wasn't, I would have heard about it."

"Not if it just made it as if they never happened," Harry stated quietly. "It was… it was bad. Forbidden magics on a level I don't even want to think about. Every one of my friends, gone. Every person I knew. Gone. My family. Gone. As if they were never there. Except for me. Because I was there, somehow I wasn't affected. I don't even know how other than it violated so many laws of magic and still happened."

And then something clicked. His eyes wide, he just stared at Harry. "… You are a Potter."

"As I believed we already established." Harry agreed with a nod.

"The reason you don't exist…" Charlus stated and horror covered his face. True, absolute horror.

"Is because my parents no longer exist." Harry stated quietly. "Wiped out as if they never were."

It made a terrifying sense to Charlus. There was never a doubt that Harry was of Potter descent. And he had been hitting wall after wall trying to find out how it could be. There had been absolutely nothing he could find about the man.

Because there was nothing to find. If everything had been wiped out, then there was nothing to find. And this man…

The horror only grew as he couldn't help but ask, "How many? How many were lost to this? How much family did we lose?"

"Too much," Harry stated simply as he shifted uncomfortably. "I… would prefer to not say more than that. They are gone. And the only person who understood enough about what was done went with them."

"I…" Charlus stared at him. "Then when you came to Britain…"

"I have nowhere else to be. Nowhere else to go. If they hadn't attacked me in that pub, I would've probably just drifted into the muggle world and stayed away from the Wizarding World entirely."

"And the reason you were in this Riddle's head without him knowing, it because it's been wiped away?" Charlus asked, pressing for more information.

"Yes. But it's not perfect information, I've already found that out," Harry stated with a sigh. "With the changes… I only know a bit of what I would've if things were unchanged. Because of it there are three horcruxes I don't know where they are. I've already looked."

"Then this Voldemort is truly unstoppable?" Charlus demanded, anger starting to swell up in him. "There is no point to this?"

"I did say I had learned quite a bit about how to deal with these wizards, didn't I?" Harry responded back as he gave Charlus a look. "I'm going to destroy the horcruxes of his I can find. Then I'm going to destroy his body. When his spirit tries to flee so he can reincorporate himself, I'm going to catch it, bind it and then I'm going to trap it in a deep, dark, hidden place he won't be found and won't be able to escape."

"Incarceration?" Charlus stated, as if mulling over it, glad for something else to think about. "That seems a bit… lenient for what he's attempting to do."

"Killing him would be the lenience," Harry stated flatly. "He will be trapped. He will not be able to move. He will not see anything but darkness. He will not hear anything but silence. He will not feel anything. There will be nothing to smell. There will be nothing to taste.

"He will be trapped in the hell of nothing but his own mind consuming itself. By the first half day he will be begging for oblivion. By the rest of it his mind will be damaged beyond what can ever be healed. After a week of it?"

Charlus stared at Harry, his face again graced with horror. "That… that is monstrous."

"A monstrous fate for a monster. And trust me, Voldemort is a monster. If he could manage it, he would make Gellert Grindelwald look like Albus Dumbledore in comparison."</pre>

<pre>Harry's mental grumbling halted as soon as he walked into the Great hall. There his eyes, not to mention his ears, met with the strangest sight he had ever seen.

Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger were faced off in the center aisle, toe to toe in a shouting match and the professors were sitting back seemingly enjoying the show! Strange, shouldn't someone be putting a stop to this?

". . . furthermore, just because the pure-bloods have always had a monopoly on all high ranking, prestigious positions doesn't mean. . ." screeched Granger, her face red.

"It's tradition, Granger!" Malfoy snarled, interrupting. " But then, what would YOU know about OUR traditions and culture? You are, after all, an outsider, it is OUR world!"

"Your world? I think Her Majesty might disagree! And as for tradition! Shall we talk about tradition?" Hermione arched an eyebrow smugly. "You value traditions so highly, yet almost all pure-blood families take any squib born to them and cast it out. They deny their own children a family and a name, all in the name of tradition and purity of blood."

"Leave it to you to focus on something so ridiculous. Squib children have no place in our world. . ." Malfoy was stopped abruptly when Hermione broken in once more.

"I was told that pure-bloods value family above all and yet when a newborn fails to prove magical, it is cast out and forgotten. A practice, I might mention, which is still in effect among only the most primitive muggle tribes when the child is female, or not perfect. . . it is not, however, a custom practiced by civilized societies!"

Draco Malfoy shrugged. "This is tradition, it's worked for more than a thousand years. Who are you, an outsider, to question it?"

"I am the daughter of a squib. As such, I feel it is my right to question!" She huffed, then continued. "Has it never occurred to you that the blood a squib carries is the same as that in the veins of its parents and their other, magical children? Why blame a child for lack of magic when it was obviously the parents own imperfect blood that created it? That they are at fault for producing a child with no magic, not the child. Perhaps it is they who should be condemned and barred from reproducing again, to keep their obviously flawed bloodline from spreading!" Hermione's words fell into silence as the students and teachers sat stunned by her logic.

Malfoy stood before her, mouth open in shock.</pre>
